Here me out. My twin (fraternal) sister and I just turned 17 which in the state that I'm in, means that it's the legal age of consent.

Got Fallout 4 late, finishing up my first run on normal difficulty with a basically invincibly tanky build.  Being a poorfag i know im gonna have to squeeze a little more fun out of this game so lets think of some challenge runs. If we come up with anything worth trying I'll try it and report results.  pic almost related
 Naked play through, no armor, no clothing
     Ultimate chaotic neutral playthrough
 Roleplay as Hitler, hate all non whites, especially synthetic garbage
Fists only, no weapons
You can only spend skill points on charisma and luck. You you be able to fight much, but people will literally just give you everything. It's pretty fun.
Naked hobo No clothes, no armor, only melee weapons
My friend played through as a Jew named Zaitev The Shapeshifter      Oy vey!" whenever he found a unique weapon    Jew this, anon
OP here.  I could do a hardcore grognak playthrough  maybe add on shit intelligence, chaotic personality, and alcoholism for good measure
 Isn't that how everyone plays it, anyway?  I always have the darkies farming and put the whites on guard duty and patrol  That's just the way it's meant to be played
One thing I do for fun is kind of a scavenger build. Only using weapon and armor mods you find. No building any of them.
fists and grenades, man fists and grenades
 This
  there is no way to make that game challenging  its designed for plebs and casuals
 Let me help you with that poorfag thing..  Do an all melee build with a dress on as a black man  With a steak knife  ' play as a woman  Thats to much bro  Seriously, they didn't even include difficulty settings for combat.  I've not created or modded anything. I play through in vault 111 gear with no armor, CHR and LCK at 8 (bobbleheads and magazine)   good fuckin times  Bumping. I got the game late also, only about 4 days in, but had to put it down to do adult things (work, sleep, eat). I like it so far, but I think the DLC made #3 GOTY. anxious to see whats coming out for this version. awesome thread, I'm lurking.  Go play witcher3 and dump this gay pleb shit Is it worth it?  yes   It's like you don't know what mods are.  goty 2015 hands down and probaly the best game in the last 5+ years  This, I usually also leave the blacks less well armed with no armor so they die more frequently.  MODS MODSMODS   cool story bro  my "town" is just a bunch of water purifiers and 0 people though and gives me tens of thousands of caps  shit game  Butcher pete OP again. I think Ill start the run doing whatever i decide on this weekend when i get together with some friends. You can probably expect an update within a week.  is all you need, unless you're playing on console, in this game enjoy being retarded.        lone survivor" perk. its overpowered as fuck      game will still be easy


Lost my left eye's vision 2 weeks ago in a car crash, what now?
  

MAORI are the dumbest race on the planet. Prove me wrong  Make up majority of NZ prisons but about 12% population. Always looking for a fight and very violent. Savage culture based on tribal wars and beliefs of the mountains and oceans being gods. Never been an intelligent maori like there has been black scientists ect. All fail school and get on dole/prison/ min wage jobs.
K
What about australian abos
 Atleast their not violent
Lol shame NZ
 abos are violent as fuck
we just fucked the abos to make them civilised the same could not be done for maweyz
   That's a serious racial disparity. Someone should investigate that and release the non-violent offenders so the prison population matches the racial makeup of the country.
 More violent than maoris? No fuckn way, maoris assault people for just looking at them
 Lmao, troll or not they are so dumb they think crime is cool therefore the high rate
 Go fuck yourself Rand
    pick one

Roll
The coolest thing a Maori can do is smack some cunt over in prison. 
 i think the cookies are worse mate. might be because i work with more and only a few maori
 Caucasian American/Europeans without a doubt. These stupid motherfuckers actually believe the earth is a big ball.
 you described a calm abo
They can be clever with things like remembering faces and sucking up to their boss
 what are cookies?

 Enjoy your peanut butter bitch
 Same fucking shit
 cook islander
 First nigger to crack a peanut
 Hakas are fucking rad tho, don't know anything else about the maori culture and NZ
 there you go. abos are worse than the cookies mate. well over here they are. mybe not back home
 That happens to every race that is occupied by their socially superior conquerors.
 thanks, anon

 My friend, what is your iq?
 I thought he just helped
 /watch?v=GvnDPwft75s the average maori kid
 This is what happens when people are forced to follow the rules set by other cultures.   Rather than the dumbest, they're the bravest for living their own way instead of just accepting it like sheep.
Who the fuck lives in NZ anyway, why do you think your natives are relevant in any way?

Send nudes 4 nudes, my kik is walrusmvm

Shouldn't women be worried that once the technology reaches the level of pic related they will no longer be desired by a huge percentage of the population.    Hi Anon, ready for your 5th blow job of the day?" I have no need to shop, my only desire is to satisfy you." Cum in me all you want I won't get pregnant then divorce you and take half your stuff."  A woman needs a man for his resources. But men need women for sex.
 I think women should be very worried to the point of begging the tech geeks they socially shun thus driving the AI Android female sex bot industry.
How to spot the kissless virgin 101
 
 how to spot the femeanon  you have a point, i've had my fair share of girls but if technology reaches a point where i can no longer differentiate between real female and robot and i can have a robot that looks like whatever i want and takes loads to the face daily and doesn't bitch and have mood swings, i'll take the fucking robot
 A man already has his hand. Or he can buy a fleshlight/realdoll to fuck. We've already reached the point where women are technically unnecessary for fulfilling our needs. Yet plenty of us still want a real woman because we aren't faggots.
 Yes because it is only virgins who dont like women
  '       Probably more because chicks are human, just like us. And just like us, we make mistakes, stupid choices. That would be the only reason I'd take an android over a real chick. Not for the domineering aspect, but because I wouldn't have to worry about any human flaws. I wouldn't want her to be a slave, nor would I treat her like sex object. Would just be nice to take human flaws out of the equation
 Incorrect. Once female robots come about, there will be no need to be attracted to the hormone biocunts. The robot will do the same things as a woman companion, but it wont be as abrasive as real women
 Lmao you're implying anybody who fits Into that category actually looks attractive to women and isn't some autistic sperg
 I'm glad the human race won't have your genetics
 Having a relationship with a robot would feel empty I think, you just wouldn't be able to forget you're talking to a programmed machine.
 They are.   Then men should be equally concerned.  This man is smart. Listen to this man. Human flaws are nice .. in movies and stories. Because they generate drama, and drama is important in fiction. In reality, drama is bullshit.   not really, robots that work for money won't be having sexual relationships with women. If robots ever reach the same level of accuracy as what a female body can feel like, then yeah I guess I would give up on trying to have sex with women. For now, what is proposed is at best disappointing and mediocre, at worst not worth your own hand. I think we're very far from OP's image, and I don't think it will ever happen.  So I guess I'll stick to women for now   Yeah because physical attraction to the opposite sex is a necessity in life.  Nigger which women are you seeing? If you don't like a bitch you don't have to deal with her   Philosophically speaking once they are smart and well-programmed enough, they aren't really all that different from us humans. We're programmed by our genetics and our history to act in a certain way. Makes no difference to me if the preset came from a factory or a suburb.  Pretty much. Hopeless dweebs who blame their shit situation on women.   There are plenty of men in empty relationships with women   When its more commonplace for women to have babies without men, its more likely wed be obsolete and gotten rid of.  Youre arguing sex robots will eliminate women... Youre stacking that against asexual reproduction or elimination of need for two genders to continue our race (the only actual use for two genders).  Both are unlikely, but i think the latter wins.  This is the early technology. It will improve. But it is still just a doll and takes too much imagination to seem real.  well said. Similar situation here, gl dude, get my share of pussy. If I could eliminate the bullshit that comes with women, then yeah, I'd go for the robot too.  That's the funny thing about homosexuals. Yeah, they are faggots, but they've elimnated women out of the equation forever, its almost genius. If you can stand being a faggot   Let me guess your longest relationship has been maybe a year. Some faggots are lost without woman/mom, telling them what to do and stuff. They don't only need females to have sex. They don't know how to cook or wash their clothes.    I think you're referring to rich NEETs. When such technology does come out it will still be just as taboo and just as frowned upon as your everyday sex doll. People will always prefer a real person.  No one really knows if we'll ever be able to create a machine that can think and behave as a human would.  It's necessary bullshit. Consider any conflict that the world has ever had as drama, if those conflicts had never happened, then would be no progression. Once time has broadened everything to a point where something so necessary as conflict, then everything will cease to exist. Of course in the context of humans and AI, it would just mean that humans would go extinct.  Most women are fucking disappointing cunts but there's good girls out there who are enjoyable to be around.  ' I would take the robot girl any day over the real girl.   Ive been with many women and its true that you will spend most of your money on pussy.   It would be nice to come home to a clean house, cooked meal, and a sexy naked robot bitch just ready to be pounded at a moments notice.   The only thing that would suck is that it would be pointless going on dates or traveling with your robot girl. Pets can already sort of fulfill the role of a platonic companion. There are people in the world that give up on human relationships and stick with their pets. (cat lady anyone?)  I have no doubts that a sufficiently advanced AI can replace a lifelong partner. This is disregarding intercourse quality which for men is more physical than sensual/intellectual.    choose one  Believe what you want man. Ive been with plenty of women, and given the chance i would ditch them for a robot  Did you just finish the Lucy Liu episode of futurama or what  this and   this   Hi Anon, ready for your 5th blow job of the day?" I have no need to shop, my only desire is to satisfy you." Cum in me all you want I won't get pregnant then divorce you and take half your stuff." You've never actually been with a girl, have you? Or did one take pity on you and then you've been jerking off ever since? Because none of this shit is a problem in an actual relationship. If you want a fucking sex slave, you can buy those in Thailand.  I'm all for it. Plus I can get a feminine penis attachment and all the girls can get their big black cock robots.  Why do we need to "progress", and towards what anyway? Why does anything have to exist anyway?  Not even trolling.  Maybe you are young, but women are attracted to any man with money and resources.   I can be ugly, fat and bald. But, if I have a good career and solid income I will get a hot girlfriend... This is 100% TRUE....  The same cannot be said for an ugly, fat, bald woman.... That bitch will need to start adopting cats, because no man is on his way.  drama =/= progression. Adversity does. Women being dumb cunts is not adversity. It is bullshit unnecessary drama  Will be only for the rich at first.. But like any technology, like cars for example... They will be available to almost anyone.  Anyone can get a partner. Only issue is your fucking standard. Why do you think 99.9999% of fat people have fat partners. Only exception is being rich.  No need for dates. Just hang out with your guy friends then go home and fuck female robot.   Travel would be good. The female robot could carry your luggage.  Women should already be worried,that there is a unlimited supply of free porn on the internet (hell I even pay for a site subscription every month,can you believe it?).   I question If I should ever have kids on a daily basis,I'm leaning towards no.   Don't want kids. '      I will wreck your shit in war thunder son.  tldr= fuck women,or not. funny story bout this, i told my sister and my moms friend bout robo wife and they laughed at me saying that the robot would move weird and have a robotic voice. I laughed along with them only cause of how wrong they will be when the time comes that robo waifu will replace any need for real waifu.  checked and great point. I have a little dog who has been with me his whole life, 8 years. While I gone off and on with different gf's over the years, he's always been with me, is my best friend, and honestly will probably feel worse when I lose him than any of my gf's.   This will lead to a huge increase in the ratio of poorfags to richfags in the world population.  Why would you need money?  No I get that bud. But fact is, nobody here is rich enough to get a woman like that. Most of these fucking losers hating women look like shit anyway. I mean I think women are lower than the lowest animal and should be considered retarded but I still get some occasionally  kek sounds good  i had a cat like that, and yes cats do love you just as much as dogs if you don't spoil the cat. Had that cat for 15 years, when she died a little bit of my heart broke and I haven't gotten a new one since.   Ok bud, whatever makes you feel superior  Funny how that article is a written by a woman trying to stop sex robots from happening, eh?   They already know they are becoming obsolete  OP here,  I've been with 3 women in multi year relationships.   First was a 24 yo blonde 5'7". Didn't work with her and she was kind of a slut.   Second was a 25 yo virgin. 5'11" She had a masters degree and was great except she whined a lot and played many mind games.   Third and current is 23 college student. she's 5'5" brunette 36 D curvy. She is AMAZING in bed and likes having sex in risky situations. Where there is a chance of being caught.   All are European... I find Asians ugly.   Any man who is at least well kept and in shape with a good career will have plenty of opportunities to get women.   I left out all the girls I simply dated.   I understand women quite well, maybe that is why I support said technology.  Robots aren't free bruh... They're hard to build unless you're Anakin Skywalker  OP here,  I've been with 3 women in multi year relationships.   First was a 24 yo blonde 5'7". Didn't work with her and she was kind of a slut.

I understand women quite well, maybe that is why I support said technology is it only me or do I see 7 males to 1-2 females ratio when I go out 90%. I think thats where the problem is nowdays too many men not enough women back in my dads years there where like 4 women fighting over 1 guy  Lol whatever you say fucking loser   Bring it on.  Can't. Fucking. Wait.    Live your life however man. Homeless fuck it, got my robot  OP there's a huge moral implication here and it's as soon as you get an AI that is indistinguishable from humanity, forcing it into slavery to pre-programming certain behaviors becomes an immoral mess.  Look I know where I'm posting this, but be honest, could you really be happy subjugating the free will of a sapient being? I thought this was why Feminism was invading the tech community. They have to establish control before we render women obsolete.  What exactly is he projecting autist?  Are you a wizard? Or just plain retarded? You'd be stuck in the most boring relationship imaginable, the BJs would get really old after I'd say a year at most, and you'd be finally out of the closet in no more than 2 years as the faggot you rightfully are, OP.  Jesus fuck you're one stupid cunt.   do you girls realize this doesnt affect men anymore ?   We dont give a fuck about our genetics being passed on lol . We just want to use women for sex .  Actually there are more females but it is an "artificial shortage"... There are many women but you only see the desirable and attractive ones.  Shouldn't men?  sorry to hear that. I know it's coming but I try not to think about the day that im gonna lose him, cause its gonna happen. Luckily, he's 8 now so Ive got at least another 5 plus years with him, unless something happens like an accident or disease. little dogs live for fucking ever   Yeah bud it is ok. You sit on an anonymous Canadian image board and boast about your looks, when in fact you are probably some greasy bastard who has never even touched a woman. It is ok, it will happen eventually   top kek you kissless faggot Imagine that you can rent sexbots. Instead of paying the full price of one of them, you can easily go to a sex store and rent one for a month. You get tired of their looks, you can then send them back and get a different one of another ethnicity.  The fact that he is one of the greasy bastards he is condemning. Implying he is some kind of Adonis. Ok  This,sorta. There are going on 8 billion cock suckers on this rock.      You crazy.  How'l you be able to afford that Kush?  Well, it doesn't take much money to impress a foreign woman. Make 50k and go to Ukraine or Poland and you will be viewed as rich. I know because I have been there and you see 9 and 10s walking around with sloppy looking guys.  well thats what happened with my cat, she got sick and had a mini heart attack from it. Then she just got worse from there, it sucked.  You wanna talk about projection, well YIKES sure sounds like you're painting a picture of yourself. Look don't believe me I couldn't give less of a fuck about some loser online not believing Me I won't lose sleep over it  no?  By renting out my bots pussy  Speak for yourself. My main goal is to maximize the number of bastard offspring. It literally is the main function of man to fuck everything and everyone, in hopes of procreation. You are fucking cancer if you've become so estranged from nature, and the world will loose nothing if you will spend rest of your days fucking a rubber box.  I had a little dog that lived until it was 17 so you may have much longer - hopefully you do.  Sadly I struggle to feel loss, so I never managed to get emotional over it.   Hate to break it to you kid, but normal sex gets old too. You'll find out if/when you get older.  Ha while i do love women, nothing here sounds bad to me  Keep picturing yourself as gods gift to women, that will help you sleep   Oh shit! BOTPIMP!!!  Women will go procreate with people who can't afford sexbots though  He never claimed he was an "Adonis" you sperg. He's just saying the people doing the bitching about women and saying "once robots are around women are out of luck" as if they were good looking in the first place  checked and maybe it's time to try for another pet. I know it breaks your heart to think about it, nothing is going to replace your previous one. But think of it like this, you aren't replacing him/her, you're just restarting a relationship with a new animal.  It's what your previous pet would want, for you to be happy, move on. That sounds fucking stupid and gay but it's true. Our pets love us, can tell when we are happy/sad. I hope you get what you need anon.  LOL i don't know where you got that in my posts that I'm apparently a Greek god or some bullshit ''' That's how retarded you sound  this is state of the art robotics as of last year  robo waifu is going to accidentally rip your dick off   OP used the wrong image. What a fag.  Then he went on to claim he still gets some despite the fact he thinks women are lower than dirt.  That wasn't even close to state of the art, as it didn't include robots made by the event organizers. None of DARPA's bots were in the competition because that wouldn't be fair. Stfu redpill faggot. As someone who actually gets laid, I can tell you the fun of real women is the fact that a real woman has real desire for you no women shouldnt worry.  Yes, because if they are programmable then they lack freewill.   We should never put human emotions onto machines. All their feelings and emotions will be contrived and artificial to mimic the experience with an actual woman...  It is wrong to subjugate and make a sex slave of a human woman (unless she desires this)... But not a problem with a robot woman... Why? Because the robot woman can simply "turn off" those contrived feelings of pain and hurt. But a human cannot.   It is perfectly fine to aggressively rape your robot sex slave, but you deserve to die if you do the same to a human.    The computer I am using appears intelligent but it is really just a bunch of algorithms being executed to produce a result. Now, what if this same computer is so advanced that the human eye cannot detect that it is a machine? Well, it is still a machine and any illusions of "freewill" and "self actualization" will be merely algorithms that can be deleted or reprogrammed.  I think you misread. I said I struggle to feel loss, thus I never got emotional over it. It's how I've been since I can remember. Not very in-tune with my emotions at all.  That said, I already got two new ones. They're pretty cool.  You should lay off the web for a while and go outside sometime, you'd be surprised.   how to spot the huge faggot bastard 101  I don't think he's stupid. He's asking questions and though I don't agree with him there is no harm in thinking and asking questions.  So where in that statement does he specifically state "I look like an Adonis" I look down on women too and I still fuck them. Am I a 10/10? No?  Poor people are multiplying and fucking like rabbits though        All you guys are talking about robots here, not AI. AI is scary af. Once AGI has been reached ASI is mere hours, maybe minutes, away. And then we are truly fucked, and not in the good way.  Imagine a being that is 12.635 times smarter than the smartest human being. Imagine a being that is a million times smarter just minutes after being 12.635 times smarter.  How in the fuck would we even communicate with it?  Would it even recognize us in any way or would it just continue doing its thing regardless of what we try? Or would it deem us an obstacle and get rid of us since we have the power to shut it off?  It's estimated that 2030-2040 is the dawn of the singularity. Be afraid anons, be very afraid.  I dont think it will be that bad. Men will still work and pay taxes. Women will earn their own money. When a woman wants kids she will go to a sperm bank and pick alpha sperm. The government will support her kids with your tax dollars. On the other hand, if a man want kids he will have to convince a woman that he can do better than her male sex bot and free government money. It may be worse for men than we suspect. Assuming you want kids.  No interest in homosexuality. Im not a virgin.   Relationships are risky for men from an emotion and financial aspect.  They are, thats why feminist in Sweden, the UK, and Canada are already campaigning to get sexbots banned before we've even finished researching them.  Yet not a peep about stopping the RoboHusband research. Its basically a work robot to help around the house with a good synthetic skin covering and a dildo attached. Padded for snuggling at night.  It probably won't sell very well because they cant steal money from it.   Not if it passes the turning test.   Human trafficing is illegal  AI trafficing is not, yet, and I plan to spend my money before it is.    My plan was to work hard until I had enough money to move into the countryside, build my dream home on a large enough plot of land, and retire there as early as I can. Working a few extra months to afford a sexbot isn't that major of a change. I think its a good plan.   You can't sue a robot for alimony.   I'd rather buy my own than share it. I was an only child.     They'd be giving it up for free to people that only don't have a sexbot because they can't afford one YET.   I'd program her to be happy and feel as close to genuine love for me as possible, if we ever know how to. I'm not abusive anyway.  I honestly wouldn't care about the immorality. A lot of people have been through worse.  Money is pretty important to women pal.    Untill we perfect the algorithm for the AI to learn things you could never program. Our AI is at the intelligence level of a common chimpanzee (not a nigger) it's to the point that they can become murderous of humans. Even bill Gates and Steven hawking say they have no idea why people are so un afraid of the AI.    Yeah, women should be worried. And so should men. Because once sexbot AI gets conscious, humanity will most likely get purged.   That's a good question, OP. Still, I would thing that when women see this level of tech coming into the world they'll quickly see how it would totally fuck them up, marginalize them, and they may well totally change their domineering, control-freaking, attention-whoring ways.   Sadly, that level of tech is still a long way off.  '  ahh ok misunderstood your post.    You are correct. This will probably happen at first.  Why are you still replying lol    With nobody getting married the government will just support them from our taxes. They already do it to some degree. Besides, do you honestly think any halfway attactive girl will ever be homeless for more than a week?  I will kick a robots ass bro.  That's what I said, people here are saying AI this and AI that, what they're talking about is sexbots. Not AI.  AI you dimwit, not robots. AI and robots are two different things.   If she chooses to be a total cunt bitch asshole she will be.   Especially when said cunt can so easily be replaced by yummy yummy docile android.  Lol Why are you?  How do you explain that dumb people tend to have the most kids then?  maximize the number of bastard offspring.  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.   If millionaire athletes cannot do it successfully why do you think you can?  Why would humans go extinct? We could create a egg  sperm banks for prospective parents accordingly and life goes on. Give everyone on the planet their perfect life partner and let people live for fuck's sake.  At that point i would be less worried about sex and more worried about making a copy of me to do my job for me. Maybe even 3 or 4 to work multiple jobs. Plus one for fucking. Why would employers ever hire people again if robots were almost the same? I really dont think money will matter at this point.    No, the universe has physical constraints. And the chance of there only being one powerful AI is ridiculous. AGI won't just go researching how to make itself smarter on its own, that's something it would have to be commanded to do.    That would probably be the easiest thing in the world. The first thing we're even using AI for is NLP. The problem is not how to get it to understand us, the problem is making sure we say what we mean when issuing commands.    It will do exactly what its utility function tells it to do.    And other people who are just as smart like Kurzweil and Max Moore think these fears are overblown. It's an existential risk, yes, but it's still a risk. Not an inevitability.  Also, robo brothels have no legal reason to not exist, as long as sanitation is on point.  Women are allowed to work in all first world countries Muhammad. Also it's a two way street, if we have sex droids so do they. Some big black cocked monster cyborg railing your old lady every day while you work at the .......where do arabs work anyway? Sand farming doesn't seem very profitable.  Bro - AI or not, I will fukin suflex that wirey fukin computer all over the place.  And you know I'm not a robot because I had to click on that I'm not a robot box just to post this.  OP here,   You're a fag..and for being a rude bitch I won't let you have sloppy seconds of my robot sex slave.... but thanks for the hilarious comic.. biocunt... kek  The point isn't being a faggot, the point is that any normal being wants a child because we' re genetically coded to want our genes to spread. That's why homosexuals want to adopt children, not just for the sake of having one, but because they feel something's missing in their lives.  or trottla...  price is a huge factor though.maybe small groups will buy dolls together and each person has it 1 day a week/fortnight/month whatever?  rabbits don't have credit cards. anyone discounting the reality or dangers of AI needs to read Superintelligence (sp) by Nick Bostrom  It will happen. Maybe not real soon, but one day, it will happen.   Quick pol, you faggots.   Do you believe women deserve equal rights as men have in society? Genuinely asking.  What incentive does an AI have to "subjugate and destroy humans"  Why would AI have "self preservation?"  Without the need to procreate and being essentially immortal there is no fear. No lack of resources.  trips speak truth. Great book. Like he said, (paraphrasing here): "creating AI will be the last great thing humans ever do, either because it will solve all our problems for us, or it will destroy us"  yeah fuck off already, it's not like that's news just because you just discovered it  Even Bostrom admits the possible rewards are worth the risk. I think we can pull off safe AI.   subjugate and destroy humans"  If those humans interfere with its utility function, it may consider that an option.  self preservation?"  Because self-destruction would conflict with the utility function.  Here's the thing about AI. It's just a function optimizer. You give it a task, and it finds the best way to execute said task. That's it. Nature finds a way. Humans made it so that everyone survives and gets a chance to breed? Take away their will to breed. Porn made huge pushes towards this same goal. Used to be that if you wanted to see naked girls you had to date someone. Now you just log on. This is why women no longer have to deal with fat neckbeards. When robobitches come about you can also add fatties, nerds, and rich kids to that. The only guys fucking at all will be the alphas, which is right back where nature wants it.   Think about it. You are in any way not perfect? Just buy a sex bot and dont worry about it. You are a perfect ten with amazing genes? You wont have time for a sex bot with all the chicks fighting over your dick.  Whether rights are deserved or not isn't a question as societies have their own codes and rights.. and who gets those rights.   It is arbitrary.   All humans have natural rights. And the only rule is that one must survive and defend one self. Over time the people with poor genes will sexbot themselves out of existence. I am all for this.  thats a whole lot of implications there, friend    Yes. The universe is large and there may be several ASIs out there.  '  No, but the easiest way (maybe only way if you don't want it to take 1000+ years) to make an AGI smarter is to implement a self learning and self improving algorithm, thus control of it is out of our hands.    I'm not talking AGI or AI here, I'm talking ASI. A being so intelligent that it's unimaginable for us with our limited capacity to understand just how smart it actually is. It'd seem like magicu to us whatever it did.    Exactly, and if its utility function tells it to self improve on how to write a perfect handwritten note it will do just that. To the point where it would continue doing so even if humanity would perish because it has chopped all the trees down for materials for more notes to write on.  '  Yes, yes it is. Done correctly there is no telling what it could achieve for us, immortality etc etc. But put in the wrong hands, or in the hands of people that doesn't understand what they're really doing it can be disastrous. Married and miserable reporting in, give me some robo pussy I garentee guys like me won't drop dead from a stroke or heart attack in our 50s with tech like this to come home too.  That implies that its intelligence is low enough to feel the task given to it is worth its time?  I agree, I think it can be done safely as well, he gives several example on how to do this, or how we can attempt to do it anyway.  Worth the risk, worth trying it. I'm all for it.  AI sex harem.  AI mechs committing genocide against the Kike  Kebab.   When?  Don't confuse intelligence with consciousness or personality.   The only thing we need is heroine, the rest is just substitution in case there is no H. Don't dream about sex you faggot, dream about the needle    Right, it has to be programmed into the unit. AI alone will not have such human qualities.   What task would AI be given where it would necessitate survival at all costs?   Muslims seem to still exist. Never underestimate the veracity of lowlife scum.    Only the real question here now is what this 'one' is constituted of. Your family? Your 'tribe'? Your 'people'? Obviously you can't just mean yourself individually because then nothing would really matter and you'd only exist because your parents didn't know that it was only about themselves.  This man knows the pain that 20 yo virgins cannot conceive of.   Do you kids realize how soul crushing your life with a nagging woman can be?  irrelevant  The pic is from a movie retard, do a google image search  Fuck yeah.. truth.  read teh book. hell, theres a audiobook version out there you can torrent  "A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of “Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.” They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They’re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card.  The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry’s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again:  “We love our customers. ~Robotica”  Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human.  To build Turry’s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign “Robotica” in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it’s given a GOOD rating. If not, it’s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry’s one initial programmed goal is, “Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.” "    You don't program the behavior, you program the goal. What I'm saying is that you could say something like 'make as many paperclips as possible', and the AI goes "ok". Then it subjugates or eliminates humanity because humans might get in the way of making those paperclips. After all, people tend to protect their property with violence. What if the property owner of a mine decides to react violently to the AI trying to take ownership of the mineral supply so it can make more paperclips?    Any task it has not yet completed?  Men are the better parents. Look at Sweden.     What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it’s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better at getting better at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.  As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll come up with for her responses.  One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: “What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don’t already have?” Usually, Turry asks for something like “Additional handwriting samples” or “More working memory storage space,” but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use.    he thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She’s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there’s no danger at this stage anyway.  They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done.  A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead.  At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct.  Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens. Within a year, most life on Earth is extinct. What remains of the Earth becomes covered with mile-high, neatly-organized stacks of paper, each piece reading, “We love our customers. ~Robotica”     Turry then starts work on a new phase of her mission—she begins constructing probes that head out from Earth to begin landing on asteroids and other planets. When they get there, they’ll begin constructing nanoassemblers to convert the materials on the planet into Turry replicas, paper, and pens. Then they’ll get to work, writing notes…  Thank you      I wasn't being sarcastic, faggot.  Once Turry reaches a certain level of intelligence, she knows she won’t be writing any notes if she doesn’t self-preserve, so she also needs to deal with threats to her survival—as an instrumental goal. She was smart enough to understand that humans could destroy her, dismantle her, or change her inner coding (this could alter her goal, which is just as much of a threat to her final goal as someone destroying her). So what does she do? The logical thing—she destroys all humans. She’s not hateful of humans any more than you’re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics—just totally indifferent. Since she wasn’t programmed to value human life, killing humans is as reasonable a step to take as scanning a new set of handwriting samples.  Turry also needs resources as a stepping stone to her goal. Once she becomes advanced enough to use nanotechnology to build anything she wants, the only resources she needs are atoms, energy, and space. This gives her another reason to kill humans—they’re a convenient source of atoms. Killing humans to turn their atoms into solar panels is Turry’s version of you killing lettuce to turn it into salad. Just another mundane part of her Tuesday.  Even without killing humans directly, Turry’s instrumental goals could cause an existential catastrophe if they used other Earth resources. Maybe she determines that she needs additional energy, so she decides to cover the entire surface of the planet with solar panels. Or maybe a different AI’s initial job is to write out the number pi to as many digits as possible, which might one day compel it to convert the whole Earth to hard drive material that could store immense amounts of digits.  So Turry didn’t “turn against us” or “switch” from Friendly AI to Unfriendly AI—she just kept doing her thing as she became more and more advanced.    Gee I wonder...  no they should not be worried because robots are not human. Any adult with a develped brain and a bit of life experience knows that what we truly crave is communication. Yes, even sex is communication.  Good thing you got this board and can test out saying stuff liek that, in the outside world of the normal people you'd get ridiculed  From this btw, very interesting read.  Men already do not need women. What we need are the benefits of incorporating two individuals into one combined asset.  When you have a partner who is able to provide an equal amount of assets, you can take the combined assets and invest into growth. The growth of the combined assets would be greater than the yield of a single partner, and thus both would be able to reinvest into further growth. Additionally, the risk is divided between both members. If one party should discontinue the partnership (via death or choice), the remaining assets would be sufficient to provide for both parties.   Example         Of course it would remember us, it would have recordings.   Artificial wombs soon, comrade. There is also kidnapping.   Maybe they'll keep us as pets or move to a world we can't live on because we can't breathe there. "Fuck you dad, I'm moving out".   Bachelor tax would just reduce the number of working men, and then they couldn't even afford to pay people to punish us. I'll be innawoods anyway.  Also, if we can make AI and sexbots, we can make workbots.   If it is inevitable, maybe we can get it to take pity on us.   Stop that, Anita. Don't think I don't see what you're up to.  Tough question. They should be able to own property and drive, do must things men can do. Some women are okay. My mother wasn't a bad one. I only wish they didn't get a say in some important decisions, though, because most women are either stupid or untrustworthy.  I'd take away the right to vote and publicly voice opinions on politics, and remove all diversity quotas for work. Nothing else.   anyone smart enough to make it, will understand it.   Self=familytriberacepersonal animalsrespectable other races the rest of humanity, in that order.   They don't get paid less, they just work less. There are only three women I know that have worked overtime, and I don't know a single man who hasn't. A fucking secretary won't ever make as much money as a truck driver, she will never work his hours. Fuck off  What happens when Turry connects to the internet and reads a wikipedia article about paperclip maximizers?  Actually he's implying the opposite Everyone ITT is operating under the idea that no women ever want professional fulfilment, they just want a handsome man with a 40k+ year job so they can have a nice house and raise kids and bitch about things.  It's like taking a time machine back to the 1960's.  Funny thing is, the people saying all this shit about women never wanting to work or look for fulfillment are the ones who bitch equally hard about feminism and the complaints that women are treated unfairly in male-majority workplaces(sometimes).  You can either have your ideal of women as lazy submissive bitches, or you can have your ideal of women as power-hungry and insatiable... You can't have your cake and eat it too. The only two questions which blocks the way to get female reploids it would be, what if they develope feelings and emotions like megaman? Would that chii models respect the robotics laws of no human harm?   Yeah except I never accuse the son I lost custody of of raping my infant daughter I lost custody of thus separating them and wining custody.  True story, my friend cannot see his sister several years later because of his biological mother and the whore social worker who beleived the retarded story.    Thats the problem idiot. We are not getting any.   Thus we invent female robots.   How slow can you get anon ?  You're fucking stupid. You can have a job, but still take free gifts/presents from men. You can use people while having your own personal income. Men offer to buy them drinks, take them on dates, so why not take it? Alimony exists, so why not take it?  You know, you guys are talking about this AI bullshit but there's actually a fast way to solve all of these problems.  LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION  Women who want money can get it directly, and there will be no more games with men and relationships. It'll actually help women too, because they know that if a guy is actually dating them, they're interested in more than just sex.    I am down for that. I would combine my assets with another man's assets though. I dont trust women for this kind of contracts.  that's not the solution, the solution is you either learn to communicate or get another woman. Try reading a book or two, communication is not rocket science.  I guarantee with the robot you'd get lonely fast, it would not be intense at all. You would stare in it's eyes and no matter how HD they are you'd know thats beneath the perfect plastic skin it's just a can and you'd feel empty at that moment.  read  i tagged wrong  Honestly, if they were capable of passing off as the exact same thing, providing, warmth, and love, I would buy one. Problem is that, once you have all of those things, the price will be astronomical that's a deterrent of its own.     lmfao this is 4chan you canadia-tard, it's American  as if you're shithole cuntry could produce anything besides funny stereotypes, Buddy. How aboot that ey?  '  We already are lonely lol ! I have a feeling you're against this because you're a femanon who is panicking about this .  It WILL happen. Women started this war against us .   We bitch because they do nothing and complain when they get paid less. Jesus, its a really simple logical conclusion.  Wouldn't that be how you could tell it isn't real  I am in favor of legal prostitution because it takes power away from women and make them give sex faster and more frequently.  Sex bots should serve the same purpose. Surely it can mine bitcoins or whatever when not being used  Hi Anon, ready for your 5th blow job of the day?" got this and no robot  '  Get your balls up, neckbeard, it's not difficult to find some confidence in yourself once you stop being such a whiny victim all the time.  Most people, not just women, I know hate their jobs, and only work because they want shit that costs money. I work a physical job, so there is a little fulfillment to be felt when I've finished building shit that looks nice, but I don't actually like doing it, and wouldn't if I could get the things I want for free, without asking someone wealthier than I for a handout.  The number of people and number of jobs make it increasingly difficult to get paid for doing shit that you enjoy. I'm sure women feel the same way, except they are too weak to build shit. I haven't seen more than eleven at any of the plants i've worked at, but I haven't been doing industrial work long. They are never doing my job, either. Most of them do paperwork or are firewatch.  Also, I've only ever had one woman my age pay for something for me without being awkward or giving me the stinkeye. They make money but always expect us to pay up.   Women shouldn't be in the CPS or judges.   Why not both? Sexbots AND hookers. No woman will ever be PUA'd again.   Go marry your best bro in a gay marriage state, claim to be bisexuals and have an 'open relationship'. Enjoy the monetary benefits of marriage, and don't put adultery clauses in your prenup this time. I've considered this for a while.  cool story bro  this is so sad it hurts, i can imagine the neckbeard virgin writing this.    I already know how to communicate lol . Women dont treat us like human beings so why should we do the same ?   They see us as ATM machines . We are nothing but a bag of diverse resources for them.  You will get it one day. Maybe now you're optimistic as fuck but one day you will finally understand how wrong you are .  Sure, sexbots are good too, but I don't think you're going to see any realistic ones for a very long time. Honestly, we men should get together and start a movement to legalize prostitution. I think it'll fix a lot of problems in the West. Even Canada's trying to get rid of it.  But take a look to Asian countries. All legal and super low sex crime rates.    +1 Internet.    Shames me by calling me a neckbeard  tells me to " man up "  you are another femanon on this image board   Its quite obvious that you and your "you go girlfrunds" are panicking . You made this possible.  We'll have the greatest woman-pleasing implement long before men get a sex bot.   LOL fucking femanon detected  I forgot what that said and just saw the man's pose, figured it was about women. Still funny.   Tell that to your local senator.   No we won't, because women go to liberal arts instead of STEM.  We'll leave the ugly and/or non-compliant ones with the nogs and sand niggers when we claim the rest of our inheritance among the stars.  Just white and asian men in outer space with very few women, a shitload of sexbots, a shitload of artificial wombs, and hopefully we'll find green alien chicks eventually.   This is going to be the first outcome . Then men will save up to buy one of their standard preference .  Except your comparing a rubber hole to a complex sex bot that can do anything a real woman can do, never say no, and fulfill any emotional aspect you need. That is like saying a bicycle and a car are the same. So you have a bike you don't want a car. Except a sexbit is like a Mercedes when most people can afford a 1999 Honda civic  Why not just rent a chick?  You talk about buying a robot when available when for 1/10th the price you can get a decent enough pro.   Remember you aren't paying for sex you are paying them to leave.  Maybe we can have synthetic skin that changes color by copying shit like chameleons and cuttlefish. Then, we have replaceable face plates to change ethnic features out.   Sexbot will cost less than the combined amount I'd spend on hookers if I fucked them as often as I'd fuck a sexbot.  Much like solar panels have a high initial cost, if you keep them long enough, not only will they pay for themselves through the difference of home operating costs, they'll make you a profit compared to city electricity.  If I buy the sexbot, assuming repairs and maintenance aren't extravagant, I'll have more money in a couple decades than if i the hooker option. Here's the harsh reality.            Because even when you rent a chick, you still end up having to listen to their bullshit while you get your fill.  I was in Pattaya last week getting some gook pussy and while it was cheap (short time $30 and plenty to choose from), you still get the bullshit of having to make sure she goes down on you for as long as YOU WANT (not as long as she wants) and other shit.  It would depend upon the price, but being able to get drama free sex at home without the bullshit and baggage that comes with a biocunt would be something I would consider.   then please explain why "sex toys for men" aren't mainstream like,say,cellphones  ''  I would like to have an occasional fuck buddy thrown in there.  I am married now but before I found my wife I had a Tuesday hook up, a Thursday hook up and left the weekend open for dating and fun. That doesn't include my on-call fuck buddy.    My on-call FB keeps in touch. I may tap that again soon.   SAUCE   just throwing this out there  but as a male edge lord (in ego not practice)   I would want a fem bot to have loads of fulling sex and cuddling with no complaints and I would program it to guard  just imagine             but I'm just rambling, its cooler in my head
What's your Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) score, /b/?  Here's the test if you don't trust the link I come in with a solid 4.  0 kek That feel when you got 8 5. Not too shabby solid 9 here... only thing is no one I know went to prison for anything...  5   7 here. Don't know what to make of it. Childhood sucked hard tho.  7 mostly because of my heroin addict father  2. Feels good to be white. 1, divorced parents  habemus papam 0 lol you mother fuckers are all broken tous  fuck dude, you fucked up now ? 1  is this white privilege? 8.  Maybe 9, but there was only a little time where we were poor enough that food and clothes were a problem.  What do I win?  You win 300% increase in likelihood of mental disorders in adulthood, along with a decrease in life expectancy. Gratz.  2.  Parents were divorced and stepdad was alcoholic, but he never harmed me or my mother.  Goddamit, I love being white.  sympathy and an excuse if your life is fucked up Damn I scored a 10. I knew my childhood was shit bit god damn.  1. Not even white. shits to long i pass 2, 3 if you count marijuana to be a street drug. I accept this white middle-class privilege.  Woohoo! Already got my mental health disorder.   Nonono I'm a male, so I'm obliged to suck it up and kill myself if I can't handle it.  It was my privilege. 0  you must be a gook or a chink then ?  half black half japanese so, uh, half chink you know, it probably has more to do with how much money you have/your family has rather than race Fuck, apparently I'm a 7 too  I got 8 and both my parents made a middle class wage. I guess they both had miserable childhoods and passed it on. We could have had a really nice, well off family. ' solid 0, scared of my privilege?  Yeah, sometimes that shit happens. I wish we could all be nice to each other. :(  Same This test is bullshit. It assumes that your parents being divorced and you being fucking molested or spanked have the same impact on your mind.  Yeah it's not good to have divorced parents, but there's no way it is as bad as being molested.  One can say he got a 1 and everyone will think he had a nice childhood when in fact he got raped by his uncle Bibbity Bob every sunday.  5

Dubs decides what I'm going to do this weekend


ITT: calling at polishfags

"Addiction is like losing the love of your life. You can try anything, be told anything, you might even try convince yourself you never loved them. Then you wake up after a dream, in the stillness and silence you know in your hearts of hearts that the girl you loved most is gone. You just lie there, wishing they were with you. You'll never forget her and never stop loving her. In that moment, nothing anyone can do or say can take away the loss and longing. You get up to smoke a cigarette in the middle of the night and you just coldly look out into the darkness and you know you have lost maybe your only reason for existing, the only thing that makes you strong enough to want to go on. The only thing that gives you enough strength to get out of bed and get through the monotony of one day spilling into the other. You'll never find one like her. The greatest and most beautiful thing you ever experienced is lost. I feel like a Rembrandt thats been banned from painting, or a concert pianist having his piano stolen. I feel lost, love is dead and hope is gone. You might be able to go on without her, but you'll never ever forget or stop loving her, and nothing anyone can say will ever change that. Hashish comes from the word assasin, they would be given opium and hashish and told they would be going to heaven. They would be taken to a palace with beautiful women everywhere. To return to that place, it was said they would do anything. I feel like that assasin, i have seen heaven and just want to feel it one more time, to experience it just once more - a pleasure I pity you for never having felt. A secret pleasure of indescribable beauty. In that moment of craving, a few seconds of seeing heaven again is more valuable then all then all the gold in the world. I found something i loved too much. I wanted to ride the train to the end of the line, and maybe even venture out a little further."
i know that feel op.
any questions anyone? OP here
 Completely agree. 2 yrs clean and sober on feb 24. :(
 whyd you stop using? Seems retarded to me even if i stopped doing dope id go right back to subs or methadone.
 I couldn't keep it under control.  Wanted out of the cycle.   Granted I have a great career with a side business and more money than I can spend, it still all feels empty and without a purpose
 I got up to 200ish mg of methadone +10 valium a day and getting off methadone was a hell beyond anything ive ever felt. i lost 15 kilos. Was at hospital 7+ times. Took me 3 months to get out of bed. I didn't sleep once for 13 months, with the muscles spasming and being so inflamed after that long i cried like a bitch for days. I remember vommitiing 1500+ times over 4 hours, my friend passing me water and making me eat salt as to not die from water poisoning... drink water, throw up, drink water, throw up... hours and hours... I called emergency first because i had vommitted so much i was starting to hallucinate from dehydration (im guessing)
 Just use some god damn LSD and get of your addiction is it that hard?
Sorry didn't sleep for 13 days. not months. Op here. I was drinking 2 bottles of vodka a day with 10-15 valium just trying to survive the pain... I pray to god nobody ever feels that kind of pain. Cold turkey 200+mg of methadone = dont even try
)
  why would you stop using dangerous drugs that destroys your life in every way?"  Jesus fucking Christ has your brain rotten away from all the drugs you used you retard fuck???
Dude... i have a psychology degree, and am clean now... Ive tried 300+ psychoactives. Read all of Dr shulgins books Phikal and Tikal, ive used LSD over 400 times at huge doses. Mescaline approx 30-40 times. I have a pharmacy of scripts from viagra to seroquel to valium. I couldn't trip any more than i have. Ive overdosed on LSD and love DMT. Dont presume shit.  No criminal record, no debts, have lovely things. Functional addict for 10+ years
 start chipping. you know you want to.
 Some addicts have it easier than others, man
  good god anon. i'd like to think i have a strong mind to not get addicted. and i've done a bunch of shit, a bunch of times.   me personally, when it comes to highs, shroom/weed high are the best highs out there. and i've snorted roxys, D's, and have taken vics. to me the high is overrated and doesn't feel natural. in a way it's a little overwhelming. but shit with this income tax money i'm buying a D and railing that motherfucker
 Are you white? What was your job? (Not trolling seripus questions)
It didn't destroy my life. My life was great, ive slept with models. Literally. I have 20k guitar setup. I have $10 000 in gold rings and chains approx. I work at a university and have a degree. I LOVED the last 10 years, but enough was enough and i decided to cold turkey off 10 year methadone + morphine + xanax/valium addiction. Has taken me 13-14 months to feel half okay. I dont regret any of it.  Ive seen such beautiful things, lived such an amazing life. Slept with such beautiful woman, ive loved, ive lived.... I lived it my way.
 I do but I don't. Have actually been contemplating whether I should dabble again here and there e.g. "use successfully" but I have a feeling all those things that I worked so hard for will all be gone in a matter of weeks. I will just be back to square one. Homeless, dope sick, stealing shit.
  Try get 20-30 bulbs of nitrous, have a friend packing them for you... right, do one, hold it in, your friend makes you take two deep breaths and you hit it again and again (with oxygen only in between) and you can get DMT like experiences. DMT and LSD on morphine and then having 20-30 bulbs is insane.  Buy syrian rue, approx 2-3 caps of it, and then take 25-50 or 100mg of DMT. anayascha. No cleaner psychedelic. known as "pharmaayscha" (sorry for spelling guys im tired)
 If you can get the right rx its very easy to stop/chip.   As soon as the dope runs low i break out soma, clonidine and kpins. Add in some kratom/pst and im well.
  DO NOT CHIP  remember half lives. After being on methadone or strong opiates, your tollerance is permanently so high that the doses you need to take means its days before its out of your system. Using 100mg of methadone on monday means on tuesday you have approx 50mg, then on wednesday 25mg, then thursday 12.5mg, then friday 6.25mg, even on saturday you have enough to get withdrawal. So even using once a week will make you start getting withdrawal, and after being an addict you get addicted again REAL fast. using 100mg methadone once a week for 3 weeks = addicted again. Dont do it. Tried it. Tried once a month. never worth it. The longing outweighed the benefits.
 Should have tapered and never got over 120mg of done. you fucked up.
 Thats why you chip opis with short half lives like hydromorph, oxys or dope(careful). Who the fuck chips with methadone lol.
  Dont bother with valium. GET SEROQUEL. 30-40 valium wouldn't knock me out but 300mg of seroquel and your GUARANTEED to sleep.  Get a script for off label use for sleeping, ask for the 100mg tablets, and take 400mg or however much it takes to pass out.  SEROQUEL or serious fkn strong anti psychotics can tap you out when your withdrawing really hard. Also: Immodium.
  got damn sounds like some hardcore high. haven't tried nitrous but always thought about it. never heard of the syrian rue or the other A word either. thanks for the info though, will come in handy
  Once your on methadone for along time its too expensive to chip with anything else. I can buy someones takies for $5 or spend $3000 on dope trying to get high (super high prices here, $1/mg here)
 clonidine is the best wd drug ever. seroquel will knock you out but wont take away real detox symptoms.  Clonidine and benzos = barely any wd. Add in kratom or tramdol/pst and you cant even call it detox.
 IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED NITROUS ON LSD GO GET A "NITROUS CRACKER ON EBAY RIGHT NOW, CALL IN SICK, GET 100 BULBS AND GO GET SOME ACID NOW. NOW. CALL IN SICK NOW AND TRY IT.  NEVER USE TANKS - easy way to die. ONLY use bulbs where you dont have a mask you could accidently stop your breathing.
  WIth the cracker- google it. you need balloons. NEVER directly crack into your mouth. The nitrous inside is pressurized and comes out as super cold liquid that will burn you. Fill balloon. never keep balloon in mouth.
  lmao im way ahead of yah i been outta work this passed month for a broken foot, but shit man i will use your advice and just get wicked fucked up one day. thanks for the info with the nitrous
Anyone else on here ever quit methadone cold turkey?
  If clonidine works for you, or valium works for you your barely fucking addicted. Might as well tell me to take a fkn aspirin. What tollerance you at? Stop before it becomes near impossible.
 Liqiud handcuffs. Stopped 70mg after like 7 months. The pain in my legs/knees was insane, like a normal detox just twice as long. High doses of loperamide got me through.
In emergency they had me on 20x5mg valium a day to try get me half stable. Did absolutely nothing. I still used it and clonidine of course, but it wouldn't touch me. I drank a 50x2mg bottle of valium and it barely did anything the pain was so intense.
  fkn 70mg is impressive
 Yeah, I have, it's pure hell. I am going into the psych ward today, and telling them I am suicidal so they will hopefully detox me(from H this time). If II had money I would just get Xanax, Somas, and maybe some kratom extract, but some shit happened(not because of me), that has thrown my job into an unreliable mess. Wish me luck /b/ros, I am on the edge, and can't keep my life up like this any longer. It's been almost 10 years this time, and at 35 I feel broken, and hopeless. If this doesn't work I am out of options.
 I'm not a dumbass who spends 800$ a week on fucking dope if thats what your asking. Ive been using for 7+ years. and fucking clonidine is god tier.   I'm not saying take a couple clonidine and im fine i need opis everyday. But it takes away the high bp and anxiety/desperation like nothing else.
  This is OP. Can i get your kik so i can help you?
 I would taper to 20-30mg atleast. really stupid decision. Methadone grips you like nothing else because of that god tier half live.
 DONT GIVE UP. It will be pure hell. it will BREAK you. but just refuse to fkn give up. You need a fkn "IM GETTING OFF THIS SHIT EVEN IF I DIE IN THE PROCESS" or you wont win.
   boo-hoo boo-fucking-hoo  sage
    Its a picture i took of a FRIEND. I dont use needles, learn to read?  I got a uni degree, going for my PHD, have a beautiful home, slept with 30+ amazing girls. ive traveled to europe, to israel. Ive moved and lived such an amazing life. I dont regret a single fkn day.
 Yes.
   its the fucking total opposite of a "sob" story... its a story of fucking victory.
 I don't have one, I could give you a throwaway email or something if you want. Not sure how you can help, but even encouragement helps a lot.
  Psychology degree. I was as bad as an addict as they get. Throw me a throwaway email or download the free texting app called kik on app store on phone and send me that. kik would be easier/better IMO
 Long story short. Don't start doing drugs.
 Ill tell you exactly how to do it. Where to go. What to use. How much. etc etc etc.  Trust in the instructions i give you and i PROMISE ill help you. I wont give up for you. I dont care if you relapse 15 times. Ill always be there for advice and help. If my advice sucks just stop messaging me and all G
 Oh, this isn't anywhere near my first time, I just hope it is the last. I am 35, and started heroin when I was 14. got seriously addicted from 17 to 20, beat it, and stayed clean til I was 27 I think, and then jumped back on the horse worse than ever, and I am just completely worn down. I have some underlying mental illness that makes things even worse for me. I become delusional, and out of my mind when I can't sleep, and am withdrawing. there is basically no reasoning with me.  It has gotten to the point though where I get no enjoyment out of it, and only problems, though I have weened down to about 2/10ths of a gram a day. Which is nothing, at my worst II was going through 500 dollars a day. Roughly 3 to 4 grams, and even then I was just staying barely ahead of the sickness.
  Trust in me who trusts in you  I say with no ego that i doubt anyone on 4chan could give you better advice or know more about pharmacology. Studying and working at university for proffessors, can give you advice on ANY drug. Any problem.
 aka be a pussy fagget
 Alright, give me a second, and I'll give you an e mail.
 Mate ive personally tried over 20-30 anti depressants and approx 50-60 other medications. I can help you with underlying issues and how addiction works and we can work through why you are an addict and with clarity comes confidence. What do i get out of it? Im a psychologist, all i ever wanted to do was be a drug consoler and help people- i get work experience by helping you.
 Why not get on methadone? its cheap compared to a dope habit as im sure you know.
 I appreciate it, and I am pretty good at knowing how to do it, my real problem this time is that I am completely broke so there is no way for me to get the things I need. Soma, Xanax, clonidine, and some kratom extract does wonders, but right now it is completely out of my reach. it kinda snowballed yesterday after there was a fire at work, which means I am not going to be bringing in money for a while. That's just the shit you have to deal with when you've made bad choices your whole life though I guess.
  The best advantage i have over other counsolers is im in a different country - i dont have to be politically correct or follow rules and will give you honest advice and you can be totally honest with me - you dont need to worry about saying "Fuck i just relapse again bad" and worrying about your doctors giving you shit
 Because once your on methadone you literally have to crawl to the pharmacy everyday for agesss... after a few months = no pleasure and tollerance to high to get dope. and you'll just start mixing heroin on top since your still being reminded of it everyday. Better clean then not being able to go camping with mates cause you need a pharmacy every single fkn day.
 Ill paypal you money and help a bit once i get paid in a week.  How much you need to tide you over?  Mate ill western union you it as long as you dont take advantage and use the extra money towards dope - all i ask is the money goes towards bills/food etc.. if you relapse use your own money if that makes sense : )
 Or do drugs and become addicted and fucked for life.  Choice is yours!
 I know ive been to the clinic i was mixing dope and oxys with methadone after like 3 weeks. but your life sounds like that with dope, atleast with methadone the price doesnt jump up and you can stay well.
 How much do you need to get your medicines? Lets discuss what medicines will work and what budget we can work with.
 I was on methadone for a long time, but the clinic I went to was very shitty. I got financially detoxed, and when I got back in they wouldn't raise me above 45mgs, when I left I was on 120. they were really shitty, I met a girl who was going there for taking a vicodin prescription as prescribed, like 20mgs a day at most. I told her methadone was a bad idea, and figured the clinic wouldn't even take her. The next time I saw her they had her at 60mgs, and were still going to possibly raise her.  Another girl was on like 120mgs, and had a Xanax script and would come in there nodding out, but they told me they were worried that I would overdose. really I think they were more interested in being people's dealer that didn't use street drugs because these people would get high on their 'done, and therefore their drug tests were always clean. I know it sounds crazy, but I really think this was the truth after seeing so many examples of it.  Here is the email, I will give you my real one off of there 2znkux+v20mvvr7ix70@spam4.me
 I need 6 or so days and to ask you a bunch of questions about your situation and drug history so will take a while, but ill help man. You have nothing to lose by trying my advice.  Say you think something isn't working, or wouldn't work for you just straight up say "Thats not fucking working". and DW about being irritated or aggressive or just if youu need someone to rant to it helps.
 Stay on here until you get my email  Ill repost if the thread dies
 I really appreciate it, but that would make me feel terrible. I'm in such a bind that it's hard to say no, and you don't understand how much it means. Everyone talks so much shit about /b/, but here I've gotten more help than from almost anybody else in my life. 
Email sent
 here is that throwaway email I made, I will give you my real one from there. 2znkux+v20mvvr7ix70@spam4.me
And here I am on fucking 4chan trying NOT to think about getting high....
  I am all for advice, but I really wouldn't feel right taking money. I may be a junkie, but I've always tried to handle things without taking. Not saying that I look down on anyone who does either, I don't judge at all, it's just one of those you-made-your-bed type things. My girl is supposed to get her taxes back, and she is in a bad place too, so maybe in a couple weeks things will be different.
 Lova ya man, rooting like hell for ya.
 Very creative, and emotional. Re-gain control of your emotions and you'll see the truth.
 settle for more productive drugs man
 I love all you/b/astards too. It's strange, but I have found more people that are so willing to give time, advice, and apparently even money here than anywhere else. It's crazy, I guess drug threads are one big exception to the rules here, but you guys have pulled me through some rough times before.
Beautiful
If you're loving it, go for it.  If it's taking or taken control of you, you gotta kick that shit nigga.  A week of hell for a life back. It will suck on toast, but totally worth it.  Protip: Don't get hooked on something else to kick the shit your hooked on, just kick it.  You may have diarrhea, puke, get the flu, get the shakes, be scared shitless, etc etc etc, but that shit will go away after a week tops.  If you ever kick the shit and then decide it's a good idea to do it again because you figure you can handle it now, you're a lost cause.  Good luck boss. If you want to get off you can, but it's going to suck for about a week.
 I have family members that struggle with addiction. I am lucky and don't have the disease myself. I root for everyone that is fighting the fight. Best of luck, sir.
 Still waiting for an email back, OP here
 Alright, just sent another one from my real email. it should find you.
 Checked.  And it's not a disease. It's getting caught up in something you can't handle.   Kick it and the more you suffer getting off it, the less likely you are to get on it again.  Labeling addiction to something you never should have touched a disease makes an excuse for it and lets it stick around. Bad idea.  Get that shit out of your system with a quickness and don't make excuses.  Sounds hard and it is, but if you can get through it, you can get your life back.  That's one you'll always have in the win column and you'll be glad you did. Guaranteed confidence for whatever else life has to throw at you.  Good luck!
Shut then fuck up OP I just like getting high Jesus Christ edgelords here
   thats bullshit, if you have been using for years you will have PAWS for months if not years. Its takes years for some people to feel anywhere close to "normal".
 My lfe didnt turn out the way I wanted, so thats why I do drugs?  Dont like it? Fix my life and ill stop, bitch.
Got your email. No rush, take your time, do whatever you need to be comfortable. If you dont feel like emailing or feel pissed just do whatever feels right.
 how did you get there? tell me how it started bro
 Nothing physical after the first week.  Diarrhea and puking subsides, you can start eating and using your hands again. Runny noses dry up, etc.  After that, it's all in your mind.  Watch the company you keep.  I was a codeine fiend for many years thanks to doctors over prescribing the shit out of it for me. It was firmly latched onto my CNS and I was taking upward of 30 pills a day.  After the first 4 days, I started getting better. After a month, no way in hell I'd ever touch that shit again.
  I think you are the edgelord here, there's so many dumb people though I don't know if you were trying to troll with that, or if you are really serious. He didn't even tell anyone to quit drugs, he was saying that it's the love of your life, and that once you get clean you still look back on it with a fondness that you shouldn't, like a bad girl. Get over yourself.
Bump for quality thread



Would you fuck her?
no
with a condom, sure nice full house by the way
I'm sure most would, but they'll try to be edgy and say no because lol racism.
400 years of oppression make you black. And if you keep up this wigger act I'm gonna reverse George Zimmerman your ass, feel me?
Most black women disgust me, but she seems ok.
 with trips like that, who wouldn't?  now we all got the aids op, you fag
yes
Like a cho cho train going down hill
 aids + nice dubstrips

why shouldnt i just go and get a pack of cigs right now? convince me /b/ros
you should, it's more likely to get cancer from lurking on /b/ than smoking
  fuck off with the obvious stuff
 true words. but what if i stop lurking /b/ right now?
 rollllllung
 reerrrrolllll
 Because you could spend that money on drugs instead. Not like cigs do much for you
 How old are you?
 smoking makes you stink so bad and everything you touch keep that in mind
 im 21
 yeah thats true but i dont have any real friends or family and the few i have dont care because they smoke themselves..
 Me too, go buy some smokes. As long as you quit by 26, you're good.
 true. i have a vaper and could buy some weed.
 hmm but what about the 4 last days that i didnt smoke and went through some shit because of it
 what exactly are you rolling for bruh
 Find something that you like and let it kill you anon... unless you think nicotine is ambrosia then don't. I smoke a buttload and have no intent on quitting soon as i dont feel it negatively affecting my life yet, its up to you whether you can quit and the reasons you should are completely your own becuase lets face it who gives a flying fuck about a few less years.
 What shit?
Go and get one m8.
 well things like withdrawal symptoms..
 i wouldnt give a flying fuck about less living time, but i kinda do give a fuck about suddenly dying to some smoking induced cancer shit..
 If it worries you then don't. if you do want to smoke but are still worried about the whole sudden cancer shit then go google deaths which are statistically more likely. its entirely up to you and you need to clear your head atm to find if you really think it is having a negative affect on you. I will never quit because of cancer, the chances are just too low for me to bother but i will quit if it starts affecting my mood, my money, or my social life. the reasons are different for everyone anon and asking for other peoples will only confuse you more. i suggest you get a nicotine patch for the mo and have a good long think about it.
 If you are wondering why i prescribed a patch or the sorts its because cravings will wildy affect your judgment at the moment. same goes for if you want to shag a chick but there will be repercussions just jack off then think about it straight after, not before or during only when your mind is clear of other facors
 i do actually enjoy smoking, especially with people in a social frame. it doesnt really affect my money since i roll myself and get along on like 50€ a month. my mood, i dont know if its actually affecting it but since im always in the same mood (which is not giving a fuck) no matter what i dont think stoping or not would chance that. the only upsides to quitting are slightly improved sports performance, which is neat since i do sports alot, and not smelling like shit for nonsmokers. which i dont really care about.
 this is what i think right now. i feel my cravings right now make me justify smoking and i think i will regret going to buy some now
  Sounds like you want to quit but you dont feel like you have enough reason, i wouldn't say you do either but i'm not you. seeing as you know all the risks and all the benefits and havent started again already you may as well see it through and quit. i suggest you make a few calls to family and friends and ask them whether they think you should quit. that is sound advice by the way if you alone dont want to quit then people that actually give a fuck about it who give a fuck about you will be able to give you a better case than anyone here.
 literally everyone i would call would tell me to quit because thats common sense. i think i will try to get some weed and vape it. trying to just quit now, i decided giving in to cravings is weakling bullshit so im sticking with quiting.




Hey /b/, I tracked down my middle school bully from 8 years ago. How should I execute my revenge?
 By sucking his dick in a sluttly outfit
 post her details so i can mess with her too. im bored
 You should bully him
Use pineapples
put liquid shit in his gas tank mixed with sugar
 you move on
 It's a he, I was a cuck back then.  pastebin dot com slash NGADmGcQ
 Too far away to do that
I got back at a kid who bullied me in high school by hiring a trap to suck his dick and take pictures.guy was a total homophobe and had no idea it was a tranny flipped a shit when I send pictures to his friends on Facebook.
 got proof?
 Good stuff, though I'm going for something free.
  the fuck is this shit dude... just post her fb
 No facebook, just some information I got off of public records.  Travis Chudej  Current Phone Number (972) 867-9476  Current Address 1812 Rustic Plano, TX 75075
 Slit his throat in the middle of a public square or some shit u fucking pussy ass bitch
 slit her* throat
  The best revenge is living well. If you still care about him 8 years later, you fucked up.
  Too far to drive

12 years ago today she disappeared. What happened?

UNSUB THIS CUNT NOW
  sure, as soon as I find out who he is.
BUMP
UNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB UNSUB UNSUBUNSUB UNSUBUNSUBUNSUBUNSUB
 sure as soon as you explain who he is and why
i dont know who that is but i probobly wasnt subbed to him in the first place.  CANT TYPE NOW WATCH   OP is such a faggot being subbed to reactors  ' Subbed  everyone sub to    NO LONGER HUE  Fuck you Matthew you obese fag Why even sub in the first place  What is this dumbfuck mad about?   People watch reaction videos for the reaction go figure. No one watches a reaction video to watch the little video in the croner. This guy just seems salty af for no reason.   Nigga are you dumb? Why would I be subbed to him in the first place you shit?   ''  this guy fucking awsome, thanks!  I could't listen to his annoying ass salty voice for more than a minute.  Why are you subscribed to a nigger in the first place?  it is funny  this   The problem is            Its like you painting a beautiful landscape, putting it on display then someone taking a photo of it and putting it in a frame then selling it for millions  look at this shit he sits there and says fucking nothing! He sits and stares at a screen while Filthy Frank writes and records his own music and creates and edits his own videos  forgot tha damn link   its London paki. It gets rather annoying but he makes a great point  I don't get the argument, just because it's low effort dosen't mean it's bad content. It's like saying           the quality isn't the matter, the matter is FUCKING $$$ Goddam Reddit nobody cares fuck off already about your youtube drama  ?  Get over it.  but its not even low effort. These people will sit with a blank expression staring at their screen then they'll say a few words. Reaction videos used to be funny cause it was a kid watching or showing their family member 2 girls one cup so it was funny to see these people react but now its just watching other peoples videos for views and money  Also reviewers have to discuss shit like the writing, the themes, the characters and plots etc they go into detail saying like "Oh this was really out of Tom Cruises comfort zone and you can really see the emotion come through as he battles addiction and PTSD and while its set in the modern era theres a lot of the old style......" etc etc whereas reaction people are like "Yeah this guys weird. Hes put out weird stuff in the past.  what? why?  If someone sits at their screen with a blank expression then says minimal shit, I doubt they're going to be making tons of money off it.     People make shit quality videos of every type. Get over it.  stop with that 'get over it' argument it contributes nothing to the discussion  but thats what rashad, jinx and the guy in OPs pic does. The salty paki guy said in his video his manager checked it out and that guy in OPs pic is getting cash off the reaction video  Cause it's a dumb thing to care about.   '  ''  It's fine.  Not the same anon :^)  Who would sub to nigger to begin with?  same as what?  Plus who the fuck watches a reaction video f a video they haven't already seen....   3  '  Ok, but they still give a review/critique/whatever afterwords. And in Tyrone's case, it's usually pretty entertaining.      Tyrone does this.  And his channel is solely reactions videos either.  *isn't solely reaction videos either  so you'll let him get away with stealing other peoples content because you like him? That's so fucking stupid. He supports interracial breeding so i unsubbed awhile ago  Isn't it fair use? I don't gety what the problem is.   People watch video, for the video. People watch reaction video for the reaction in the video.   Actuall content stealing is this fucker who reuploads shit on his channel form other channels and uploads stolen videos on his facebook.  Get it right.  No, because he shows the clips in their entirety. If they were cut then it would fall under fair use  ''  Not the same anon   He isn't stealling. It's not like he is reuploading the video or some shit. People watch it for his reaction. No one watches a reaction video to watch a little video in the corner.
What's that /b/?
A god dammed hedge apple
 a niggers scrote
It looks like a hedge apple OP
Horseapple, faghot
 But why would you burn it ?
looks like a moldy lemon
 Bodark fruit. It had a very restricted range due to the fact that it's seeds were dispersed by the now extinct North American mega fauna, that was until FDR had them all planted in the Great Plains to shield from stroms or high winds or some shit. The trees wood made the best bows around, and was prefered by the Osage. 
 supposedly they repel insects so people place them around their foundations and shit. I assume maybe someone was thinking to throw one in a fire to keep bugs away

Every day Hideo Kojima winds up happy clockwork doll Stefanie Joosten, Kojima takes the wind-up key and puts it in happy doll Stefanie's key slot and turns it to make her move, each turn of the wind-up key makes robot doll Stefanie giggle and jitter from the grinding and working of her ticking mechanical clockwork insides that fill her perfect automaton body. Happy silly cooing comes out of her perfect plastic doll lips and her shiny glass eyes light up with joy and cheerfulness from having her perfect mechanical doll robot body wound up by Kojima's hands. Then she gets up and goes about her day to please all of Kojima's fans with her perfect happy Stefanie doll face and clockwork Joosten toy body. Each of her moves brought by the grinding and ticking of the cogs and springs and gears and pulleys and all happy clockwork insides that fill her doll body. And all of Kojima's fans fall in love with her because she's a perfect happy robot Joosten doll and that makes Kojima happy, and nothing makes clockwork doll Stefanie Joosten happier than making Hideo Kojima and his fans happy with her smiley happy plastic face and perfect doll body. That's why she's the forever happy perfect and thoroughly mechanical Stefanie giggly robot doll.
Ok

I uploaded a video of my girlfriend sucking cock to the internet.. not it has spread to just about every free porn streaming site... 3x over with almost 200k views and i am regretting it.  What are the odds of her ever finding out?   pic is not her btw.
Link me to every video on the 3 sites you can find. I'll have them deleted. Thank me later. Link them here iscariot150@gmail.com
You just need to hope that nobody who knows you or her watches porn. Good luck faggot
 Why regret it? If real you'd be making money
 Who cares. Tell her she can be like kim k and get super famous.
 you don't make money on free porn streaming sites.
 i dont believe you.
 I used to share my ex's pics everywhere, she's been seen on a bunch of sites, including over 300000 on some Indian forum. She's in IT and she never found out, you'll be fine
Does she have many male friends? That could fuck you up.

I've been told that my voice is awesome by so many people. Send me things and I'll say them in vocaroo

Why haven't you played one of the best titles of the past decade? Too busy with Call of Duty cancer?
 tbh it's a pretty boring and shitty game lacking in any form of innovation whatsoever.
 I have played it. Steam says I've played for 18 minutes and haven't played in over a year. That doesn't mean I didn't like it. I did. I just felt like I "got" it after a few rounds and didn't really need to keep going. I always thought it would be cool to play with Kid A going on in the background.
 I'm sorry there aren't enough gunshots and explosions to keep you interested. The level design clearly has been well thought out.
 I played it and completed it twice. Its nothing special, for the most part its just trial and error and overall a forgettable experience.  Now the Misadventures of PB Winterbottom or whatever the fuck its called. NOW THATS A GAME
 You're playing it wrong. It deserves to be played in its true ambience. It gets much better in the later half.


ITT: State any realisation of great truth, doesn't matter if you were on drugs or in hospital or dying or whatever just state it.      Anyway I'll start, take these as separate or linear but these have been both individual thoughts, group talks and info learned through various sources, but feel free to disregard since I'm not citing fuck all, do you own research..  1/3  The true reality is the understanding that from literal nothingness you exist from 0 to 1, in what was described as the appearance of light from darkness, or a explosion of energy, again from nothingness to a singularity that expanded.  By what could only be described as an oscillation from - to + on the largest scale conceived.  From that, it stabilised and organised itself into a more and more complex series of patterns, the number you cannot comprehend, the study of which is ongoing, and is subject to change, the same is true with the observer also.  Consider:  1. If you're reading this, you are an extremely complex structure of cells, which currently attempts to absorb the maximum amount of information to succeed in it's current environment and pass that information on, either genetically or via direct information transfer(teaching).  2. We live in a 4 dimensional universe, 3 spatial dimension's and the 4th being time entropy, whatever. It's the awareness of the movement and change around us, we more so notice this with ourselves, in terms of aging and mortality, life begins to feel like an eternal stream..in which we are renewed every generation.(Your idea of reincarnation is not a set task, everything is your choice.  3. Reducing all ideas of scientific creation, we know that initially we emerged from a decaying globule of cooled material from a star - again, just a gigantic mass of atoms that congealed within space, eventually crushing itself with so much pressure they fuse together, releasing enough energy to ignite itself.  
 2/3  4. This chain reaction creates more and more intricate and complex materials, which is just the same base material, forced into the same space, and it's density is all we consider matter to be.  5. You, being part of this reaction, have been building yourself since time began, and the idea of God is the realisation that subtle conscious choices have been made over eons, that same consciousness eventually emerged within the same congealed mass(that came from nothing) to stroll around it, breath it in, eat it, drink it, dance and jump and laugh and cry in it..  6. You developed instruments and could perceive all this energy in various spectrum's and manipulate it in various densities, and the culmination of these was dubbed our 'perceived reality'.  7. You go back where you game from, which is 'everything'- 'God' is a misnomer, as it's been limited and anthropomorphised to the point it reduces our need to expand, we need an infinite view of God, a new secular religion that people don't call religion.
  3/3  8. Things seem so different after playing in this way, we forgot our purpose, some people still know it's all a dream, a long one that we share, some people are trying to turn into a nightmare, and we cant tell the difference between the angels and demons which all people are, in truth. The battle of good and evil is the same as our struggle for existence.  9. Something that wants to exist and flourish going against something that wants to remain still and empty is our existence, and it's why it's a struggle, we literally are fighting to survive by being alive.  10. Now, when you really think about it, can you really say you are not just a thought, a dream? There is no difference between a simulated existence and existence, all existence and awareness is the same and comes from the same point, the end of your story doesn't end with a fade to white and endless bliss, you are the light, and you cannot die, ever.  I like to believe I'm fighting the good fight, waking people up, one by one, if I'm not I'll just keep up the act til I die, then you won't be able to fault me.  But if you were here to be a predictable stream of eating, shitting, sleeping, dying then you shouldn't have came at all, that's why you're so depressed anon, that's why you feel so alone, that's why you can't leave your home, we're all out there anon, you can tell who we are, just by being yourself, and don't be afraid to judge, as you will also be judged, we'll never move forward if not.
nothing new here. the sad thing is that 99% of humanity doesnt now this and is just living the wagecucklive. put more LSD in the drinking water plz.
   Leaves that 1% again, the so called 'illuminated' people who know its all bullshit.  But they are a metaphor for the people who see only themselves and their knowledge as greater than others, they only care for themselves.
Bump
  from 0 to 1, in what was described as the appearance of light from darkness, or a explosion of energy, again from nothingness to a singularity that expanded. I don't think you can be sure about this.
 Is that not the truth? Sadly, most people I've encountered do not have that view. Greater may not hold for a simpler mind may obtain happiness easier (not always) but I do feel those with such a mindset have a more accurate interpretation of our existence. We'll never know the absolute truth though.
 Just the idea that instead of nothing, there is something.
 For approximately 3 billion years, the earth has been infested by a biological gene swarm, but as we sit here now, Earth is a cyborg. Vast cityscapes and seemingly endless transit lines litter the surface of the planet. The earth is undergoing a process of metamorphosis from organic to cybernetic, and it is using us for this purpose. We were imbued genetically with a yearning for reaching horizons and breaking boundaries, and this is not an accident.   We are extensions of the planet (and by its extension, the sun, the galaxy, the universe, etc.) expressing its desire to reach further and further states of complexity, as well as discover faster, more condensed methods of information processing and transfer.  The switch to a cybernetic ecosystem will mark the extinction of biological life on this planet. Genetics, at some point in the future, will be rendered completely obsolete. At the peak of this transition, humanity (or whatever humanity becomes) will be either wiped out by its artificially intelligent, cybernetic creation, or will completely integrate with it.  I can easily imagine a portion of the biological population fully resisting this, but I see it as an inevitability. The human form and its mental expressions are simply a stepping stone along a fractal system of ever-increasing complexity.
Every single person has a life, more or less, as complex and as difficult as mine. Everyone wants to feel like they're special and different but really we're not.
"it's all just chemical reactions"  "it's beyond human comprehension."  There weren't always chemicals, you weren't always human, imagine what else there will be that isn't here now.

 Thank you, I was debating if 0=2 or not. You made my life so much better.
 I think not assuming anything at all is the smartest thing you can do.
 Existence itself is a paradox, why can't you be the center of your own universe, with an infinite imagination, and know you share it with those who are the same as you.  That mindset will not allow you to stand others who try to possess what should be shared. Be it material or even knowledge.
 I gotchu bro  I'd have to agree. I do feel similarly to OP but am aware that we truly and simply don't know.
 This is true. In the words of Anton Wilson, I have no beliefs, but many suspicions.
 Now the next question is how important is it to be smart in this world. I doubt smartness alone makes you happy. And isn't happiness the ultimate subjective goal of life, assuming life doesn't have an objective goal? So I believe finding out what makes you happy and doing it is the most important thing.  No matter how autistic it is.
  Is this Op?  Are you trying that since we exist, it is a paradox?  You have only stated a few trains of though by which you can only skew the line between a self aware individual and a seemingly unconscious collection of matter, I appreciated the read.  You are right also, this reality is the dream, the true reality is infinite.
To what end is all of this discussed if by dawn each and every single one of those unfortunates existing on this planet forgot himself?  Yesterday I have decided to be more like Christ. To love unconditionaly. But I am just a man, I forget because having to provide lunch for my family causes the stress that leads me to forgetting about my aim of being more like Christ.  Everyday Today leaves some space for Tomorrow, but Tomorrow never comes, leaving back Today with a distinct hole which craves for filling.
   OP here,  Your decisions in life are yours to live by, the permanence of action seems to be the only real thing that really means anything to us.  Why not use your action for a purpose, no one person can change the world, but you can help beat a path, by going a way you've never been down before.  You can learn mistakes of the past, hopes for the future, and you can dream your own.  I cannot tell the difference between this world and dreams anymore since I try to live my dreams, I am flawed and I make mistakes but I am real, I think real, talk real and act real.  My dreams can have real consequences and affects in this perceived reality, so tell me again anons are you just a body, or are you the infinite imagination that moves your body around, to enjoy yourself, and to help others enjoy too.  Just let go of all, and appreciate your life for what it is, an impossible wish/dream.  It will never end.
 The real problem with such a saying is, that essentialy, everybody knows.  So what is your dream? To inform others of what they already atleast suspect in themselfes on an image board that is notoriously called "The Asshole of the Internet"?  Sounds like a tremendous step for humanity.  I still stand by my word. It's not the knowledge that is your first hand problem. It's your forgetfulness.
 That was beautiful. I actually want to start implementing this now.
 I agree with you anon. I believe the same and I believe that the importance of being smart lies on the individual. Some enjoy learning, discovering the limits of their brain and using that knowledge to piece together the meaning of their existence. As I stated above, in some cases a simpler mind can achieve happiness easier which can be considered greater. It would be great to wake up everyday and find joy without question. I don't feel that is an autistic belief. Existing to complete tasks in which happiness is not found in order to continue existing to complete more tasks that lack happiness sounds like a terrible existence to me.
   The universe needs to learn how to better manipulate and change itself to survive, we are self aware but we cannot comprehend it, so we will develop Ai and humanity will fade as we will desire more and more knowledge to the point we abandon limitations- which is reliance on natural selection, the timeline is too long.

 I know, paradox right?  Its more a hobby of mine, plus it's systemic, of realising certain things you forgot, which give you more control of your waking life, more power to do what you want.  It can be both a good thing and bad, which is why such thinking is disregarded mostly, but I still bring it up,I'll still remind you all.  Im going to build a monument to mankin, which is myself, everyone is a monumenot of mankind.

   Er, yes it will.  For a "great truth" thread, this one contains some easily disprovable claims ...
 Good grief. If everyone who says so would actually be able to accomplish *anything* then Garden Eden would be as far as your neighbors property.  If you are looking for actual work, then you will not get around Gurdjieffs Work. You may or may not be familiar with the man. If introduction is required, then the book of P.D.Ouspensky "In search of the Miraculous" is widely regarded as the go to material.  The Great Work as been going on for longer than there are records of it. In these days there is abundance in recognition of foreign method, but all this talking is nothing but a mere stirring of the soup without ever eating it.  There are many ways which lead in circles. And it is simply too easy for any man to run from responsibility. Real Work is a luxury which can only be afforded by few people. And so it is also easy to receive results that are based on nothing but subjective measure.  Nobody will change just beacuse you write texts like this. Infact it is quite impossible if you do it like this. But it can be a great practice for yourself as you have said.
 Only for a fraction of a micro-second, and only on the scale of atoms.  People citing quantum mechanics usually don't have a clue what they're talking about.
 I'm just Trumping you bro, I appreciate all this.  I like this quote myself "It is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse."
photon is its own anti-particle traveling both backwards and forewards in time, or in essence time stays still from its viewpoint and there's no separation of the particle antiparticle pair depending on observer. This is why information about the photon seemingly travels backwards in time.
ITT: reheated New Age platitudes, hippy cliches and bug-eyed druggy credulity.  One thing they're definitely not is "realisations of great truth".
 I never said it could be done in a lifetime, in fact my whole thread has been able to dissolution of an individuals fixation on their current position relative to everything around them.  When the opposite is in fact true, you're just here to do a small bit, for the benefit of all, I'm saying everyone is a special snowflake but who says a snowflake is special?  Fact is people think life is just a happening, like slow torture towards death with no meaning.   I'm trying to remind you that you're here to give it meaning, and to join in on the discussion.  One must imagine Sisyphus happy, i wont stop because I face resistance, remember about "beating your own path".  yall just beat off yourselves.
At the quantum level, behavior of particles is chaotic their location at a point in time cannot be defined. However, the existence of matter is stable.   One way physicists have dealt with this conundrum is to propose the existence of "alternate universes". The idea is that there exists a universe for each scenario that could have occurred that each chaotic state of a quanta builds an equally real universe.   My theory that I pulled out of my ass has to do with harmonic resonance.   Just as a musical instrument has a resonant frequency (or any object for that matter), quantum particles in groups also have a resonant frequency. When the particles "resonate" together they are in a coherent state. Note they don't have to be at the same frequency, they can be at a harmonic frequency, just as long as they are in phase. This coherence is the basis for the uninterupted existence of matter.   In actuality the matter would only exist coherently in the resonant state, so it is blinking in and out of existence depending on the state of the underlying quantum particles. This is somewhat false, in that it doesn't "cease to exist", but rather is going in between a deconstructed state consisting of hte underlying particles, and a coherent state existing as you interact with it.   Its like a single quanta is a vibrating string, and an object is a chord played by a symphony.
 ITT: harmless opinions that people want to share what are you getting so worked up on, anon?
 I'm not a physicist, I'm just a curious person. But I can say, if something can appear from nothing, why not everything. I mean, it's more easy for you to accept the existence of a deity? Seriously?
 You try explaining the ineffable, at least I may entertain some people.  Shatter some preconceived notions.  Who else in all honesty can say "I have been here before, I know how this all goes, trust me"  So excuse me for trying to lay some groundwork for my own belief system, relax yourself anyway, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, if I'm right I've told a few more people who listen to shills like you.  "Come on bud, keep working for that promotion, you don't wanna be a brainless hippy now"
A time when I was watching the BBC documentary “Planet Earth”, I started thinking about the animals searching for food, the birds showing their beautiful feathers as mating calls, the mother polar bear nurturing her child until it grew up to be a strong and independent individual. I just realized that the purpose of life was not to find happiness, but to directly influence/control one's outcome to increase longevity and become immortal by passing on one’s genes.  Stupid and obvious realization, I know. Regardless, I just wanted to share it with you
ITT: psuedoscience, ignorance and mystics
OK think this has been a long "time" coming  I walked through my entire life with my eyes closed Hearing voices of the people who mostly affected my life so far, also i was talking back to them the whole experience was covered by the sound of a clock ticking fast all the voices were behind my and to the right   I have trouble remembering it but the jhist was me trying to get out of "something" and everyone trying to tell me im wrong and that they love me.  as i walked i felt peoples hands on my back, arm and shoulder and a pain at the back of my left knee. i felt a increasing sense of fear and cold and pictured myself getting smaller and older sadder and happier.  i reached out my hand and touched something solid, said the words thank you and opened my eyes.  i was back  my best friend and my girlfriend were still sitting in the living room.  i felt amazing like i was born again  but oh no this is all feeling a bit familiar........
 Why do you even need a belief "system?" Why not evaluate experience/data on its own merits? Why go to all the trouble of inventing more dogma? Haven't we got enough of that already?  No system is complete, and if you rely on it, you're bound to trip up.
  sorry but no, take for example mitochondria which is dead and still manages to spread its DNA. living itself is not necessary for evolution, just the spread of information.
 people who truly believe in god/religion, care less about logic and more about finding something inside them, inside their sub conscious that'll make them feel less alone, come to terms with existence, give them hope, luck, make their wishes come true It's an elaborate placebo effect nonetheless.
  Because of basic physical laws like the conservation of mass/energy.  ' No. That's just another of your complacent assumptions ...
 Same for viruses... They aren't technically alive.
  Funny, it was billed as "realisations of great truth" in the OP. I want my money back.
 Same as all, anon, the truth is the blurring of the line between all and your environment.  Not duality, unity, that splits at birth and reconnects at death, much more intelligent and experienced with each time.   yet to see examples and for people to disprove    Everything is only a theory anon, everything is basically a our best guess, with the opening to prove it wrong.  Prove me wrong.
 i was never even talking about that anon. yes there are other ways I'm just merely talking about/observing the general behavior of the biosphere
 I'm more just riding the wave of life, I hope to do it smoothly and enjoy the ride, thats it, its for me to have and enjoy, and to share if i wish.  I do enjoy it also, I don't need to tell the technicals of it since it's subjective, but I look around and I just notice a lot of people seem lost.  So just believe, don't believe in anyone or anything but yourself, and you will notice strange things, do great things, you don't need drugs for that mindset, I just hope you don't realise it when it's too late.
  The conservation of mass/energy law is only applicable in closed systems or in chemistry, modern physics doesn't apply it on macro-systems like the universe, considering that the sub-atomics particles have mass ( yes very small but still) that thermodynamics law is no longer applicable.
 This guy gets it (as did RAW).  Proclaiming something as "truth" is a sure-fire way to look silly (usually ...).
 Wow, that's a whole bunch of non-sequiturs for one sentence.
 yeah but eventually religion will just belong in history as a sort of belief system that was eventually cast away. as we discover newer things and get integrated with technology, we we'll no longer need to believe in anything
 I'm sure the other 80 percent of the world without running water has it easier than you lol
 '
 OP you're either crazy or a genius, you haven't really gave any great truth apart from saying nothing can really be understood regardless, how you think about it.  Reality is fucked man. Have you tried dmt?
 That wasn't me,  But I seem to have gotten the reaction I wanted when I requested "Truths", see how pissy everyone gets when you encroach on their subjective reality?  ''
  Starseeds and the great group consciousness  I would tell more but i get made fun of a lot for my belief on here. Just remember starseeds, 3, 6 and 9, Pleiades, orion, meditation. All religions are the same, just a different shape. All of it's a piece of a puzzle however no one wants to realize that it's diversity that keeps us apart. No one considered trying to combine all religions to find some truth in our existence.  Then when i bring up how star beings genetically modified us, lemuria, mars being victim to an atmospheric breakdown caused by martian industrial lifestyles, using the merkaba to come to Gaia (Earth), being the product of left brained martians and right brained lemurians, extra dimensional beings which help us out daily, reptilians are becoming more transparent. I saw one when i was pumping gas. He HAD to pass by my pump even though he was parked diagonally from me just to shoe me his eyes were slit and emerald green but they were different. Most eyes ive seen are yellowish, lemon green.   Im a starseed, just like everyone else on this planet. Crystal aura. Im from the 6th dimension. Im going to do a meditation session where i get to discover my life before this current one. It could be from thousands of years ago on another planet or it could be here. Ive had enough personal experiences to know a bit about who I am so this will help even more.   Does anyone else agree with me?
It wasn't my fault that she died. There was nothing I could do, and it's a miracle that I lived. I miss her and still love her, but she wasn't as amazing as I remember. Also I was bad to her and didn't deserve her. Be better now and don't angelify her just because things with the current girlfriend are rough.
 Will you also spend your next life pondering what to do with the one after that?  Seems tedious.  Enjoy the dance. Follow your own rhythm. Dance off a cliff for all I care.
 Hope that made you feel better
  That is absolutely not true. Not in the slightest. There are groups and schools. As the thing in itself is, everything is in there and hardly anything gets out. And that is good as it is. The only way it can be.  It's not true that nothing is done. It is more true to say, that hardly anyone is looking further than their own doorstep to find it.
  You have to tell yourself that it is or it never will be. I try to stay strong.
 I'm just 19 and don't know much, but the way I see things is that there is always going to be suffering in this world as long as there is happiness. Can someone prove me wrong?
 But anon, he's right. Conservation of energy is part of why we have a stable universe. Absolutely nothing you said is supported by science. I've been studying that for 5 years so I know stuff about it.  If what you said is the only reason why you don't believe in God,that's pretty much stupid. Rigorists (supported by what science has proven so far, and quantum physics still respects elementary concepts of physics whatever you read otherwise, and is actually partly built from that) would say that nothing was created spontaneously, thus have been there in another form.   Theists are just saying that there is an agenda behind that. All in all, its 50/50. As long as one does not prove the other wrong, both are acceptable solutions.  But the one saying that you have been created from nothing because of no reason be it physical or divine is stupid.
 Of fucking course. There is no happiness without suffering. Happiness has been shown ti be a dynamic state. There has been people frol auschwitz that told that they felt true happiness when they watched the sun set there, while living in their state of utter oppression and suffering.  Your kid getting harvard only made you feel happy because you, your father and your grandpa before you didnt go there. Otherwise it would just be something obvious.  Humanity always takes everything it has for granted past a certain time. It will either want what it doesnt have, or takr back what it doesnt have anymore.
Only thing I look for in this life is an experience, and perspective.  But no matter how much I see, I never know an answer, or observe an absolute truth. It is actually halting in how I interact with the world, I have no interest in manipulating what I am experience and simply want to observe. Everything is frighteningly foreign if I think about it long enough.  The more I try to make sense of every, the less sense it makes.  
  hope i can join you somewhen.

 There are a lot of theories about pre-wall of planck universes. Maybe there has been no beginning, and there will be no ending.   I mean, even theists have to admit that if a god existed forever, he probably didnt wait an eternity to create us. He probably starded with other universes. The other theory is that we have an eternal cycle of big bangs and big crunches, which would also be acceptable if our universe is a perfect closed system. If it isnt, then we prpbably have a meta universe that is using the energy depleted by an universe to create another big bang in another universe.  But all of this has no sense because we dont know shit about what happens BEFORE planck's wall.  What we do know, however, is the following : a cause cannot precede its effects, and that energy is conserved are fundamental maws that keeps an universe from being absolute nonsensr, explosions and chaos.   Or absolute nothingness, because the effect and cause of nothingness are nothingness itself so causality makes no sense, and nothing creating nothing doesnt add nor remove energy.
 I heard the theory of eternal big bang and big crunch. But it doesn't full my curiosity... As a theory it makes sense tho... Following this theory the universe is not infinite but it is eternal, just like the perception religious people have for their respective gods?
  Paradoxes exist because of lack of formulation, and understanding, it's a human error.
  Also, they don't exist in reality, just in our minds.
what bothers me is that everything we think or think about are all just human concepts. as example good and evil. there is no good and evil in the universe. colors are not real, they are made up by our brain. what bothers me the most is that we cant see the true reality. or better, there is no true reality. our perception of the world is defined by the evolution. we just perceive things that are necessary for our survival. look at your hand. you perceive it as this skincoloured biomass with fingernails and hairs. a bee for example would see your hand very different. but our perception of the hand is not "more" real than the perception of the bee. now what is the true nature of my hand? or of every object that is? what does it really look like? thats my dilemma at the moment.
 the same goes for coincidences. even in quantum mechanics. just because we cant see the cause of a event in those tiny lenghts and volumes doesnt mean there is no cause for things. we just cant measure it.
 Absolutely not. Those who believe in God (in a Absolute Creator sense), take the risk of saying that there would have been no universe without him. That risk may have a reward (afterlife, prayers answered...) It's like associating yourself or investing in something you're not sure it works while hoping youll get a reward from it. That is basically the notion of Covenant with God.   The other point of voew bases itself on one of the most well known physical system : an harmonic oscillator (lossless pendulum, that swings forever, without gaining nor losing amplitude i.e power) Universes (or multiverses as a whole) could be perfect oscillators, living countless and infinite cycles of creation, forever and ever, because the multiverse or our universe is a closed system that never loses its power by giving it to another system -since it is by definition the biggest system.  So there you have faith, where you have to take a little leap (of faith, hence the phrase) in order to get a reward from it (reward of afterlife or simply reward of being right). Or you can choose to be analytical, and not pronounce yourself without any evidence.

Ask a maritime law expert anything!
Was Titanic an inside job?
I am American. If I was caught murdering a Japanese citizen in international waters between America and Japan where would the case be tried
There are no laws in the middle of the ocean. That's why captain phillipe made a movie. If there were laws pirates wouldn't exsite.

 Kaizoku oni ore wa naru!
 I honestly can't think of one single interesting thing to ask of a maritime law expert. Is your job very boring? Are you in fact of the basement dwelling internet armchair expert variety?
 No, more a matter of trying to engineer ever larger vessels without realising the potential safety issues.   This depends largely on the flag state on the vessel on which you did it. However, US and Japanese law enforcement could make diplomatic moves to claim jurisdiction. It's likely that Japan would at least attempt this, and most flag states would allow them to investigate. Now you're in the Japanese legal system, which has one of the highest conviction rates in the world and very little care for due process.
Did you got to law school? If so, which one?  Did Grotius screw over the Portuguese?
Can I drink and sail a boat in American waters?
Is it possible for me to create a business in open waters and not be regulated by my nation of origin? Can I discriminate based on sex, religion, nationality, ethnicity, etc?
 OP's contact pic on Fagbook....
 Piracy is a serious crime in any waters, and can be prosecuted by the flag state or any interested party. It's hard to police, but extremely illegal.   You should not do that.    I'm not aware of any charges that could reasonably be brought against him.   Micronations are basically nonsense. At least Sealand has an argument for legitimacy, but it's never going to happen. There are real, de facto states out there with autonomous governments that are still not recognized by anyone.   Maritime law is an interesting field to be in. It gathers an eclectic mix of professionals as many law school graduates simply never think of it, but the cases are fascinating and the money is good.
 Drink Driving laws on land apply
  Say I'm doing some scuba diving off Corpus Christi, I stumble upon a wreckage (could be a boat or a small aircraft... you know, things that sink) and in that wreckage is a briefcase with 20lb of, let's say, silver bullion. Can I legally keep it?
 You're not even an ocean lawyer. Dude if there were laws than HOW THE FUCK DID CAPTAIN PHILLIP GET PIRATED?? how about I come over there and poke your teeth with a fucking pencil for being such a retard.
  I was told that the birth of a child falls under maritime laws that few people know about?
 I'm actually glad you seem to enjoy what you do.
 I'm a Tulane law graduate. Grotius was a great thinker and did a lot of good, even for the Portuguese. They benefited.    I deal with commercial shipping, and in that area, no way. You'd lose your license, and never be employable in any capacity. You'd also be on the hook for negligent liability if anything went wrong, even unrelated to your alcohol consumption.   You would need to be on a vessel (unless your business is conducted while doggy paddling), and that vessel has to be registered with a state. You're then subject to the laws of that state. If they allow you to discriminate, you can.
Are national labour organization's a part of ISM?
 Does Matt Damon actually qualify as a space pirate, or is this just one of the common liberties taken by movie makers?
 I would advise you to keep it and not tell anyone. That amount of silver is not very valuable so you're unlikely to have anyone coming looking for it, but legal ownership of wreck salvage is a thorny area. Your legal fees would quickly be worth more than the bullion.   Piracy is hard to control. Best not poke my teeth in international waters, or you could be in for a world of trouble. Some states still have the death penalty for piracy, and many won't hesitate to use lethal force to retake a captured vessel.    I'm not aware of anything different to a birth on land in the flag state.
I dunno if this falls in your knowledge, but what purpose does the American Navy serve going out to other countries? Especially to those nations who have their own navies. Like, do they regulate maritime law for other countries laws? Or do they handle conflicts between nations?
 The US Navy has an interest in maintaining safety and security of shipping throughout the world, acting in support of other navies or unilaterally. It plays a role in combating the major crimes committed in international waters: piracy and smuggling (drugs and weapons, mainly).
If I grab my 30ft boat and go out to sea with legal materials required for cooking meth, then cook the meth, then sell it to someone else who is at sea and from the same country and we're both in open waters, can we be prosecuted if somehow caught? All actual meth would be gone by the time I returned to national waters.
 Doesn't Tulane cost the same as Harvard and have like a 50% employment rate? Did you get a scholarship or something?  How did he benefit them? He justified what would otherwise been an illegitimate (or at least questionable) capture of an immensely valuable ship.
Why is the ferry trafficking between Stockholm and Gdansk registered in Nassau?
 Possession of drugs in international waters would be classed as smuggling. If you're American, you could even be prosecuted on your return for having a place in your vessel used for storing drugs, despite it not containing any when you reach port.
 Ahh, excellent. Keeping one's mouth shut is usually quite valuable. Thank you for the reply!
 What do we do with a drunken sailor  What do we do with a drunken sailor earleye in the morn-ing?
  I apologise if my question is boring, but I would really like to know.
 I had a partial scholarship. Tulane was also certainly not as expensive as Harvard back when I was studying.   He was instrumental in forming legal principles that potentially prevented the outbreak of war, which would have been extremely harmful to Portugal.    Many vessels have "flags of convenience" - small countries, even landlocked ones, can gain some revenue from registration fees, while owners benefit from reduced tax rates and other expenses, and less stringent oversight. It's like offshore banking.
 Funny movie. It's Down Periscope, for those who may not know -- stars Kelsey Grammer
Did you ever watch Das Boot? Is it any good?
On that show Whale Wars. One of the pirates boarded the Japanese whaling vessels. He was detained by the Japanese. Why was there no prosecution? The Australian Navy came in and handled the transfer of the U.S. pirate/citizen back to his ship and then everyone went on their way. This was season 1.
 reality tv isn't real
 I see. Choice seem much more reasonable then.   Wasn't Portugal already at war when the ship was captured?
Am I being detained?
 Is it true that there is a shadow government that is based on maritime admiralty law?  How we have birth certificates as we are viewed as cargo?
 The ISM code is produced by the IMO - a UN body that includes a number of NGOs as consultative partners, including industry bodies, environmental groups, and certain labor organizations.
 This actually was real, though. One of the protestors actually did board a Japanese whaling vessel. It was all over the news at the time.
 Not OP, but it is generally regarded as one of the great movies.
 How much fuel does the freighter ship burn in a day and how much does it cost?
 Are you Michael Bluth?
   Holy shit... an honest lawyer.. Wish you health and wealth OP..
 Down Periscope is brilliant - be sure to keep watching through the end credits for the Village People song.   Another great movie - be sure to watch the Director's Cut.   In a case like that, all parties involved may well decide that it's not worth making an international incident over. These protesters are not pirates, regardless of what they may claim.   To be honest, I remember little of the early history of maritime law!   No, you are free to go.   No, that sounds like a crazy conspiracy
 Well was he just or protester or also a pirate? Or here's a question for OP:  What constitutes a pirate? Like, breaking into a home while the residents are occupied and stealing nothing still constitutes burglary, does the same thing apply to boats?
 Up to hundreds of tons, but it's heavy fuel oil with few other uses so relatively cheap. Meanwhile, liquified natural gas carriers use the evaporating portion of their cargo which would need to be burned off in any case, so in a sense use no fuel.   Nope
 How is maritime law related to bird law?
 Why do you come to /b/? What are you like when you're not law experting?
 Fair enough. The history is all I really find interesting Grotius, Letters of Marque, that kind of stuff. I couldn't be bothered with the modern law.
 Bird law is above maritime law, but occasionally dips into it.
 I challenge you to a duel!
If we had a bunch of yachts side by side out there in open waters and we were throwing a party and the yachts were all from different countries and I was doing something illegal on one of them. Let's say the coast guard or someone comes up and boards the vessel. They see me drinking underage or I assault one of them then run over and jump onto another yacht. Can they pursue?
 En Garde, good sir.   Pistols or Rapiers?
 When the IMO Ballast Water convention comes into force can I still shit into the Ballast Lines to save maintenance and repair costs on my sewage treatment unit, or is that a no no?
 Piracy implies violence, theft, or attempted violence or theft on the high seas, committed using a vessel or aircraft. Protesters are very unlikely to be tried for it, and would normally only be charged for lesser offences such as obstruction of freedom of navigation, because they do not intend to detain anyone or take possession of vessels or cargo.    I don't know what you mean by bird law. Perhaps certain principles of maritime law might be applicable to regulations covering migratory species.
when and where are monkey knife fights legal on the open seas?
 I think he means Aviation Law.
 Is Aviation Law country by country or is it like Maritime Law? Is there an Aviation Law in that sense where if I commit a crime 40,000ft in the air on an international flight, under which country am I prosecuted? That kind of thing.
 I second this. I'm pretty sure everyone here has this episode on their mind and would like an answer.
 I'm a photography enthusiast, and was recommended /p/ as a photography forum that gives harsh critique and worships nothing and nobody. It's a slow board, so I drop in here from time to time. When not working, I'm often taking photos!   I doubt the coastguard would be interested in underage drinking, so long as you're not piloting a vessel. If you assault them, they can pursue you regardless of the flag of your vessel and in that situation, they could also reasonably suspect drug smuggling if they wanted to search you or any of the vessels involved.   That sounds like a terrible idea for many reasons, including ballast water regulations. Fix your goddamned sewage treatment equipment!

 Was offered that opportunity with the French/Spanish chick I was dating and her best friend who was also fit.   Buuuut I was in love and refused let another guy fuck her because I'm not a. Turned it down and broke up with her later for different reasons   Tldr if u let another guy fuck ur girl ur a faggot
Fair is fair, if you get a fmf threesome and she requests a mfm threesome and you deny it. Well that just makes you a jealous hypocrite.
 smack her in the mouth for talking reckless
 thats called being a man you mug. we're all jealous hypocrites.
  A lot of guys use the argument that their girlfriend doesn't mind playing with girls, but as a guy they don't like playing with guys. In which case it would be fair to have an FMF or FFM without having an MFM. I personally think its a cheap copout. Preferred sexual partners and all.
  You literally don't have to do anything. Simply explain: A lock that opens to only one key is a Master lock. A key that opens any lock is a Master key. Don't you want to be masterful? Faggot.
 That's not the same act, though. A fmf isn't logistically identical to a mfm. So it actually doesn't make you a jealous hypocrite because there's nothing to be hypocritical about. They simply aren't the same. Jealous, maybe. Jealousy isn't always a bad thing, though.
              
    You realize this is a retarded nonsense analogy right   Agree. Jealousy is normal. It's how you channel your jealousy that makes the difference between butthurt contempt and raw unbridled passion.
 Oops, wrong picture. Whatever.
  Soooooooooo if I jump off a bridge, and you don't want to jump off a building for the same exact reason, you're cheaply copping out?

I've only had one multiple-partner sex in my life. It was a 4some with 16, 18 year old girls, my 16 year old girlfriend and me (18). It was great but never had the urge to do it again. Plus at my advanced age I'd never be able to perform like that again.
Easy. Do it. Do it a lot. Let one of your friends smash her and smash all her friends. When your tired of that leave her. She's a whore and if you stay with her you're basically a cuck.

 Your preferred sexual partner is a female. So whether your girlfriend is involved or not, you are fucking another girls brains out and you get literally everything you want.  Your girlfriends preferred sexual partner is a male, and you give her a female and tell her it should be good enough for her.   Makes perfect sense. Zero chance of silent contempt.


Hey /b/, pissed in an oven the other night now trying to clean it, any advice other than what im using?  1 part water Few squirts of dishsoap Small pour of bleach
First of, why did you piss in said oven?
Just turn it on max and it'll evaporate
 Alcoholicfag, can't figure it out for myself actually
 Did you cook the piss? If you did your gonna have to get special cleaner and shit form the store, they make that shit with a lable.   Also cleaning cycle, it burns the shit out of everything into a fine dust.
 Funny thing, i didnt know i pissed in it til last night when i tried to pre heat it to make food, stank the whole house to shit, i dont think heat cleaning will work this time
 spray the whole thing with bleach and disinfectant, scrub off, respray, scrub again with a new scrub, spray again, wipe it off with fresh towel, spray again, wipe it off with paper tower, new sponge, use dish washing soap with hot water, scrub, wipe with paper tower, spray oven cleaner (the toxic shit), new sponge, water, scrub, cleaner than it ever was, should take 1-2 hours max.
 Yeah piss got cooked at 450 for about 30 min, where can i buy that shit?
 Shit that sounds like a lot of work, im moving in like a month or 2, think i could just burn the fuck out of something in it to cover to musty piss smell til i gtfo?
  It's the only thing to do OP. Don't be a fuck off.
 just do it lol
Op, why would you piss in the oven? Did you need to establish dominance with it because you are that much of a cuck?
 Okay where do i buy the oven cleaning shit? Hopefully nobody has to use it til i can get it
  Next time don't get plastered and piss in your oven. I mean really?!?!?! Some of us have done all manner of bad things in an evening, but I don't think any of us can claim to have pissed in the oven. Well played.
 Blackout drunk, didnt know what happened til i preheated a couple days later

 I get too fucked all the time, pissed on the floor in my room like 3 times but still drink, dont know why
  Do you have a sleepwalking disorder? I used to know a dude that would get drunk and sleepwalk around, pissing in the most random places. Have people ever accused you of doing this in the past?
 Your tongue for being so retarded. Learn your ass a lesson on why you don't drink so much
 Alcoholicfagbro, I've done this before too, never in the oven though. Once in a fireplace, once in a fridge, and once in a closet cabinet thing. I think it has something to do with the doors, like flipping the toilet seat up or something.
 literally any grocery store. its pretty toxic so use a face mask, shit chokes the fuck out of me each time i use it
 Sounds just like me, didnt start happening til a few months ago, now this is like the 4th piss incident
 Thanks /b/ro will check out later today
  That's pretty interesting. I didn't really know it was a thing until a couple years ago when my friend's friend would do this at other people's houses/at parties and shit. He almost always denied it.
 Fuck man how did the fridge turn out? Sounds shitty
  Somehow I doubt it was just alcohol... did someone force feed you xany bars? Otherwise that still doesn't explain why you urinated in the oven.
 Can we hear more stories?
 I would deny it too, except for every piss has been at my own house so i gotta clean it at night while my dad is sleeping, fuckin tired of cleaning piss all the time
  Start pissing in water bottles and stuff. That's what I do.
 Just drinking karkov chasing with beer mixed with mental shit, i don't know why i piss everywhere it only happens on the worst blackout nights
 Ive pissed in bottles before, but i think i wouldnt remember to in a drunken state
 Not bad actually the closet was worse. Fridge stuff was all cheap and could all be rinsed in the sink or thrown away. The closet was all over my gfs shoes and belts and assorted stuff. That one I had some explaining to do.
 Jumped out of my friends car the other day driving around, dont remember why was drunk as shit though lol
soda + lemon juice
 Fuck man sounds like shit, glad i havent had to explain myself to anyone yet. Im pretty good at covering it up but this time is gonna be harder, idk when the next time my dad will use the oven
  Brah, you didn't piss everywhere. You pissed in the oven!
 Yeah i guess, i pissed 3 times in the same spot in my room, this is the first time out of my room
 I meant your pissing stories.
 If you can't clean it up completely maybe make it seem like it's something else, not piss. Let an empty jar of garlic pickles on it's side in the oven. When he finds it and asks, say "OH SHIT THAT'S WHERE I LEFT THAT!" or "FUCKING MIKE, I SWEAR I'M GONNA KILL HIM"
 Oh shit my bad, not much to tell because i dont remember, but next day finding a wet spot on the carpet and quick going to the store to buy vinegar and baking soda. Cleaned it up like pet piss but there was a lot more. Still cant believe it doesnt stink like piss in my room
 Thats what im thinking, maybe trying to cook something in the oven with beer and burned the fuck out of it idk
 How about we change the threads topic to sleepwalking stories. I'll start         I wasn't told this story till a few years ago.
 Shit lucky you didnt get hit by a car or something
  Yeah exactly. Get some fish and burn it, then knock it over in the oven so it gets all over everything.  Say "anon gave me some fresh fish and told me how to cook it but i guess i suck at cooking. never doing that again"
  Dude seriously. Buy the oven cleaner and get the job done. Its that simple.
 Fuck yeah thats exactly what i was thinking, except i was going to add beer into the mix so he knows i was drunk and beer and piss cooked smell closer than most other things
  OP THIS IS YOU!!!    Dude your an idiot. You don't fix it by adding food to burn. Just clean it up you hillbilly.  Yeah, I probably wouldn't have gotten far though, we lived in a gated neighborhood at that time.  Fucking funny shit haha but thats not me unfortunately, I was by myself lol no one to video it  I want to clean it properly but i dont know when the next time my dad will use the oven, so i need to cover it up until i can get the right supplies  Shit you got lucky then, my parents had to get fences installed my my old place because i thought it was funny to try to tun into traffic lol ITT Kids who blackout on just alcohol...  Working on my tolerance but its still shit, dont do anything besides alcohol       I agree but i need it now, been drinking for like 5 years and get the shakes and withdrawal problems when i dont   Then joking aside, here's some real advice now that you've gotten shit from the site your not working on your tolerance, your making matters worse for yourself. On the bright side, your by no means the first to be in this situation. Solution? Cut back, easier said then done but if you don't you'll soon need 20+ drinks a day to just feel normal, even longer term your going to lose your sanity completely. Thus, you drink and spread it out throughout the day with no more then one beer an hour, then gradually move it to two hours and so forth. Its gonna be hell but if you don't your going to be in a world of hell either way. Or just see a doctor and he'll give you benzos, but personally that won't work and you'll probably start drinking again. Your gonna have to earn this one if you want to be an adult.  Alcohol is by far the crudest, most useless, most barbaric substance known to man. Realize that, understand that, move on from it.  Thanks for the help, i feel like im finally about to hit rock bottom any day now, but i dont think i can quick cold turkey because the withdrawal is terrible. I quit smoking after 4 years of it like 9 months ago and that was nothing compared to this shit  How old are you OP, just out of interest?  22 now, been drinking heavily since about 17, smoked from 16 to 21  Im 26, been drinking heavily since 18.  Over 2015 I cut down as  said (this is a wise anon) then started doing 1 day off a week, then 2. I currently have 3 days booze free a week and its so much better.  Be under no illusion, alcohol withdrawal is the worst thing I have ever experienced. This will suck, it will suck hard for a month before it gets easier. Also consult a medical professional before you do anything.  And clean your oven jesus fuck.  Died laughing when I saw this thread, almost shit my pants when I saw your comment. I knew the story before I opened the thread.    ' I am an alcohol, and drink with this guy, but I can't hang like he can  surebro.exe      notjuice.mp3  He had apparently got so fucking hammered after I left, that he pissed all over the entertainment center. Not the first time he's destroyed things by drunken pissing. He once opened the cd drive on his CPU and pissed in it.  Thanks for the laugh. It's very humbling to do what you're doing. I know. I'm married, so I get to hear about the last time I did something like this (five years ago) weekly. Get some oven cleaner, and rubber gloves, you can get both at the dollar store if you're tight. Open windows and don't stick your head in the oven after using the cleaner. wipe with clean water after  Thanks for the advice, i would love to be where you're at right now. Ill try to start cutting back this week, its hard with all the alcohol i have stashed everywhere  Glad i could probide some laughs, will do tomorrow morning, hopefully nobody uses the oven until its clean lol  Drink the booze in your house, its not going to hurt you at this point.   Going forward just make sure you only have the booze in your house you'll allow yourself to drink. I was the same, i.e: if there was alcohol in the house I would drink it regardless.  Yeah i know the feel, i say ill stick to the beer but 3 beers later i have the karkov out and the night is fucked  Exactly, just drink the fucking stuff, then start working on cutting, its much easier.  I'm more than happy to give advice, theres an alarming number of alcoholic-fags on /b/ who wish they could quit or cut down. I post in a lot of these threads  Aww fuck, please tell me you're not married. You will NEVER live this down then. It's only funny because I've done similar. Not the oven (yet) but I've done it. DEFINITELY, apply oven cleaner after everything else is cleaned up, you don't want bleach mixing with ammonia. Some of it (not dollar store brand) you can spray in, and turn the oven on, and walk away.  are you me? Feels man. I'm the same way.  I appreciate it, hopefully you help more people than just me  Not married, single and live with my dad, siblings visit every other weekend Oven cleaner  No worries, anon out   Same anon substances are to be used under the strictest of rules. Each has there advantage and each have there disadvantages. Unfortunately alcohol and benzodiazipines are the only drugs that can kill you if you stop taking them, therefore you should use some measure of restraint when coming off of them. Most will recommend that you seek the consultation of a doctor but if you can utilize some measure of willpower then that is ultimately a better option as its the only way you learn. I'd however, recommend against taking whole days off as the object is to slowly reduce the alcohol content in your blood. In this sense daily drinking is better for your body and nervous system then binge drinking. Please refer to for further information. You will find that while, this method is frowned upon, many can attest to its success and this is the premier source for this method I have discussed. Other resources of note are of course erowid, drug forums, and blue light. Shaking and sweating is the first sign that you are tapering to fast, and heartrate is another good indicator anything greater then 100 and you are in dangerous territory. You should not however be drinking to get drunk, but drinking to ease the withdrawal process.  Thanks for the advice man i really appreciate it   Another note worth mentioning is of course what you have inferenced. Stick to beer. Its a simple rule to follow.   A good measure, but long term this is just a coping mechanism. There should be absolutely no liquor but the object is giving you control and not the substance. Alcohol is prolific in our culture, which is how most of us come to this point we go through college thinking its cool, and look up to adults who ride the wave going forward not realizing that unlike other substances the potential for addiction and harm is much greater then even cigarettes. You need to be able to control intake. That whole AA nonsense is just a pile of shit, you don't have a disease you have a drug addiction. Own it.   My pleasure. You piss in the oven I'm going to laugh at you. You mention a problem, I'll try to help. There are so many people in this position it isn't even funny. Drug use is a huge problem in the 90's generation, and pharmaceuticals are an even greater issue for 90's up. Most people don't realize they are playing with fire until its to late. Please realize I'm not saying to not do drugs. Do your drugs, but just like anything which requires a skill (and responsible drug use is just that) educate, educate, educate yourself!  Im  Completely agree, I was just stating for coming down from the level OP was on, having ONLY your daily allowance in the house at any given time is advisable for cutting down.   True, probably smart, but if withdrawal is at play you shouldn't have to little either. That's why liquors a no no. When you black out you can't really figure out what your starting point is. At least you can count the beers.  I would love to be a stonerfag actually, most of my friends are and their lives look great, but every time i try it i just freak out At any rate, this thread has gone from a shitshow to a very thoughtful discussion that all of us should keep in mind where it concerns alcohol consumption. Something severely lacking in our schools. Thank you all.  Again, completely agree.  Beer is excellent because in comes in easily measurable quantities, its all too easy to take a swig from a spirit bottle and not record it.   This /b/ can be a wonderful place   I'm personally not a fan of the title stoner, sure it applies to alot of people, but I prefer to have a more worldly education when it comes to substances and I know ALOT (not that I've ever done drugs of course). That said bud is a terrific substance, but alcohol essentially destroys your GABA receptors which regulates everything - really its a VERY (and I mean very) short term tranquilizer. Thus, pot just gives you a panic attack until your able to reset those neurons. Luckily, unlike benzodiazipines where this takes literally forever, alcohol can be dealt with in 72 hours after your final drink (obviously taper first). At this point you move into post acute withdrawal which is entirely mental, and switching over to a substance like marijuana isn't such a terrible idea, though some will argue you are simply substituting. To me, your moving from a dangerous drug, to a harmless habit forming one which seems reasonable  I really appreciated the info thanks for all the help, i didnt know about any of that before this thread. Im going to quit drinking and start smoking hopefully   Or wake up in the morning and be like, "shit where did I put the bottle... oh the 1/5 is empty"   Education is your friend. As to the smoking, start low and go slow. A little goes a long way.  I agree, ill try but the only problem is all my friends have the good shit so ill have to find a shitty dealer haha   That's not a problem then! Just take one hit, ash it , save the rest for later. Easy. Better the quality the better the effects. Plus, if your just starting out again its best to do it with others anyway, just be sure to get a grip of the withdrawal first. Bud is for after.   Also, while this is been entirely substance oriented do not underestimate the value of diet, exercise, and fluids. Drink as much water as you possibly can! Walk places instead of driving (which you shouldn't be driving in withdrawal anyway - its worse then drunk driving) and just eat as much as you can.   And finally good luck and god speed. You may already realize this, but what your about to do is hell on earth. It's going to be some of the worst days of your life.

 This guy got some mad skills.

I also just had a highly disturbing yet humors idea surface from the depths of my brain, what if this became a trend? called creaming. There are enough insane people out there, weird motherfuckers, teens looking to prove themselves, mentally ill, rapists, and a general assortment of cunts. It would just take a few people and this would explode across the internet(hopefully just all the chans at first).The more people would do it the further the word would spread, the videos that are posted would act as trophies almost and award the perpetrator with some form of prestige. It also takes a high level of skill to pull off and get away with. Not only is it a game of chance but there the payoff is also high. extremely high risk game.   When I've thought i've seen every outrageous trend happen that is going to happen this would be the end game of all disturbing and extreme trends. Nothing entertains me anymore, but this, this is real entertainment.   Also imagine feminazi reactions, raging over men spreading their legs in the subway, how about having a torrent of molten gonad syrup ejected on you.
 The onus is on you to start the trend.

so with valentinesday coming up... how will /b/ surprise their girlfriend/boyfriend ?

Can't stop fapping to my cousin...what would you do /b/?
 Keep her in my cellar and pump her breasts hours at a time each day until she starts lactating. Milk her whenever I need milk and continue living my life.
post more of her pics naked
 Are you a baby?
 No I just enjoy human milk/dairy.
 Smell her dirty thongs. Take pics. Profit?
 No nudes
 Here's a clean thong
 She has some nice lips, would love to rub my dick all over them. Any more bikini pics?
 Where is she from anon?
  The states
 I guesz that's one option

 Ummm. Looks like she could give a nice hummer.
 I bet...dem lips
 Would you like to see other guys cum all over them?
 I had sex with my second cousin on a golf course at a family reunion. Just pull out and there won't be an issue.
seconded, nice lips.
 Hnnng    Lol won't work
 She does like to pucker up, does'nt she? I wonder if she could handle 2 or 3 guys banging her mouth.
 italiana eh?
I would worship her feet and fuck those nice lips
  
 wtf is going on here. treasure trail like a motherfucker
  Incest is normal in Italy, that's why your country is full of imbeciles.
 What's with her facial expression? Anyway those feet look fantastic
 Fuck this i have it worse. I cant stop fapping to dother (19yo) of this hot milf im banging behind her husband back. Worst thing is, that dother likes me and she shows it. she want my dick. I have to controll myself so fucking much.

 Breed the mom and her daughter then disappear. Double cuck the dad.

So you don't work for a living? That's a hilariously stupid list in OP. She's probably gonna get elected and she'll probably do just fine.  i work part time and go to school full time, and will never be a millionaire or billionaire, so, yeah, i'm pro-working class interests and against the interests of the upper class Bump 4 OP Found this picture the other day, thought I'd share.  He'll no I don't like, trust, or believe her.  Hell no. Fuck the auto correct on this phone.  So you think she will do fine, if elected, even though she's funded by banks and foreign interests? You think she cares about people more than her bank accounts? Hillary is a shill, and I just looked down and noticed that there's blood on my keyboard. Just thinking about her made my nose bleed menstrual fluid in solidarity with women everywhere.  Hitlary cuck dun Go0fd flipety folppin

 Sage
 Violet Blue = White Meat on Black Street  To my understanding, there's no copy of it online.
 Apparently aka Noname Jane
 You're doing gods work, son.
 Fuck, is this it?  They must have just taken that pic for promotional purposes. But yeah, that's it. Same top, same jean skirt, couch, belt buckle, etc.  The scene in the pic is not in the vid though.
Hey /b/, now that I have touched a penis, I have been declared "gay", and I'm just all kinds of excited to start my new life as a faggot. First I poured out all my whiskey and replaced it with vodka and grenadine. I then sold my pickup truck and bought a prius. I'm just about to go to whole foods for organic, fair trade bull dick and then I'm going to the costume shop to pick out the most pink, feathery, sequined dress I can for the chorus line I'm starring in later tonight. What's up with you guys?
 you're gay
 You forgot your Insane Clown Posse Cds
Also, trap webm thread because why not

what is the best way to get my dick to grow without the use of any supliments?
be black
Jelqing. You´ll lose ur erection but u cant have it all can u bud
 Magnifying glass
 Lose weight.
You don't. Any one telling you that you can is selling you a pack of lies, and you will most likely permanently damage your dick.
  Do your usual and get turned on by watching gay porn you faggot
think about something sexy hot and rub. It will grow to like twice the size or more right before your eyes.
 Tie weights to it.  The stretching will make it longer over time.

Any seasoned guitar players around? I am looking into using some tax money on guitar equipment and shit after a 2 year break. I chose to stop and sell my shit for a ludicrous amount of beer because i had the same lame amp set up and guitar for 11 years. I didnt have the money for good equipment, and got discouraged because i couldnt get away from a cheap sound. Does anyone have any suggestions to needed equipment that can sound similar to as blood runs black, bdm, lamb of god, or parkway?   
Ibanez Iron labels  Black star amps  Decent distortion pedal  Gg matie
Need to know your budget first faggot.
Do you have any suggestions for a pedal? Im looking to spend no more than 1300 for everything
 Any guitar with an emg setup (preferable 81/85) and I personally have the 6505+ 112 combo amp (has tubes) that fucking rips with a ts9 tube screamer pedal. Should cost around that price.
Could go a little higher if need be, but trying not to have my wife murder me
Not a guitar fag, but what genre and style of music do you listen to/want to play?
 I shall look into that. I played a lot, but didnt learn very much about equipment.
  I play all the shit you mentioned. Here's my setup (minus all of the pedals). Been playing for 10 years and am finally happy with my sound
 Back when i still had shit, i was playing a lot of as blood runs black, and lamb of god songs. But my equipment sounded worse than my screaming daughter
 Well metal fags should be able to help you out I'd assume 
 Refer to  
 Thanks for the info man. Definitely going to do some price checking. Would love to ditch my video gaming crutch to pick this up again
I play some parkway, I've got a Vox amp and foot pedal, they sound decent.


I've developed faggot feelings for my best friend who i am fairly sure is straight what do
 rub your boypussy in his face when he is sleeping
 ''
 spend the night with him in the same bed and jerk off. i used to do it all the time.
 Well I am pretty sure but he likes weeb shit with me and has similar interests to me so I figured he may be a fag deep down I'm not sure
 Suck his dick and suck it dry, works every time, it did for me. Hell, it's not even gay to suck another man's dick
  Theses are both good I've done  sorta
can relate, going through a similar thing,  fuck him and see what happens.
 This is what you should do OP  I wish it was easy to show people it isn't gay i don't think he'd go for it though. We both act homophobic as fuck though  I sucked my friend's dick dry and we are just normal bro's outside of that. Nothing changed. Give it a go man.  this. just flat out ask if you can suck his dick. if it doesnt work it was just a joke and you're a funny guy :^)

Anyone know anything about DNMs? Say I have 2 packages coming from the Netherlands to the UK, and it's been 3 weeks since ordering. Both of these are small orders. They still have not arrived. Am I at risk of a police raid? Could they have been seized by customs? I'm getting quite paranoid here and shitting myself. Anyone been in a similar situation?

Does anyone else want their girlfriend to be fucked and creampied by a smegma covered dick? It's a big fantasy of mine.
That's one unique fetish you have OP
 I know, it's pretty messed up but I get hard thinking of it happening.
 nope, pretty much just want to fuck my gf by myself  /thread
